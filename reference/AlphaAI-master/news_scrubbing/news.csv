A new report claims that China managed to spy on large swathes of the world by smuggling tiny computer chips into electronic hardware used to power iPhones and many other products.

If true, the allegations from Bloomberg News represent the probably the biggest and most destructive hacks ever to have happened. They would allow the Chinese government to have access to devices not by exploiting loopholes but from the very beginning, letting them listen in on people's communications over the internet with ease.

But the companies involved have already strenuously denied the reports, and claimed no such attack has actually happened.

The report claimed that Chinese operatives from the People's Liberation Army had infiltrated a manufacturer of motherboards for servers, Supermicro, and placed tiny chips onto them. Those motherboards had gone on to be used around the world, including in the US, allowing the chips to be easily smuggled into the country.

It claimed that companies including Apple and Amazon had used the hardware to power their popular web services. That would mean that the small Chinese chip would be able to monitor the communications of hundreds of millions of normal people around the world.

The same hardware that powered those cloud services is also used in some of the most important and sensitive parts of US military hardware, including servers for the Department of Defense, which is just one of hundreds of different uses of the affected server motherboards.

State actors including the US and China spend huge amounts of resources on looking for software holes in important computing equipment, and they are regularly found and exploited. But a hardware vulnerability of this kind would be on a scale never before seen – much more difficult to establish, but far more destructive because it could not be fixed up or easily discovered.

China is in a particularly powerful position to carry out such an attack because it continues to make some 90 per cent of the world's computers and 75 per cent of its mobile phones. The Trump administration has continually told companies like Apple that its equipment should be made in the US instead, and Bloomberg quoted a former official as saying the alleged hack was the result of a ""Satan's bargain"" that the company had made by manufacturing its products in China.

But the companies at the heart of the allegations have not only denied them but say they have been rigorously investigated and no such breach was found.

""We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg’s reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed,"" an Apple spokesperson said. ""Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.""

It also released a detailed statement that attacked many of the claims made in the article.

""Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server,"" a spokesperson wrote. ""Apple never had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident. We are not aware of any investigation by the FBI, nor are our contacts in law enforcement.""

Amazon said that it had investigated the same reports and that it had not found the problems alleged in the Bloomberg article.

""As we shared with Bloomberg BusinessWeek multiple times over the last couple months, at no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems,"" an Amazon Web Services spokesperson said.

Supermicro, the company accused of manufacturing the hardware, said that it is ""not aware of any investigation regarding this topic nor have we been contacted by any government agency in this regard"". It said that it had not been dropped by any company for those reasons, an allegation made in the Bloomberg report."

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's  Google on Tuesday unveiled the third edition of its Pixel smartphone, a Google Home smart speaker with a display and its first tablet computer as it makes a come-from-behind push into hardware.

The company's Android software has gone from being an also-ran to the brains of most of the world's smartphones and Google topped Amazon.com Inc  in smart speaker sales in recent quarters.

Pixel phones, though, have been a tougher sell, launching with glitches and garnering less than 1 percent of the global market by shipments in Google's first two years of trying, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.

The Pixel 3, priced at $799, and a larger Pixel 3 XL, priced at $899, mark Google's latest entries for a phone lineup it hopes will someday be as popular as Apple Inc's  iPhone.

The Pixel Slate tablet runs Google's beefier Chrome OS laptop operating system rather than Android. It is priced at $599, aimed at competing with Apple's iPad Pro.

Shares of Alphabet barely moved on the announcements. Financial analysts said it is difficult to evaluate Google’s hardware business as it is overshadowed by profits from search ads.

Google branched into hardware three years ago so that, like Apple, it could have full control of the performance of its applications and the revenue they generate. Other phone makers sometimes crowd out Google's apps with their own or take a share of ad revenue, hurting Alphabet's profits.

Expanding geographic distribution should provide a small boost to the Pixel line-up. The Pixel 3 will launch in 10 countries, up from six for the Pixel 2 a year ago. New additions include France, Ireland, Japan and Taiwan.

The Slate is available in the United States, the U.K. and Canada.

A new artificial intelligence tool sure to generate buzz among consumers also could be helpful. The software, launching on U.S. Pixels only, answers calls, requests information about the nature of the calls and shares it as text with the recipient.

""We’ve built the first phone that can answer the phone,"" Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president for hardware, told media on Tuesday.

Ryan Reith, who leads device research at tech consulting firm IDC, said Google did not change enough in the Pixel 3 for it to stand apart from more well-known competitors.

""Some of the stuff they are doing with software and artificial intelligence is certainly leading edge,"" he said. ""But as a lot of the technology advancements become more naked to the eye, it becomes that much tougher to sell.""

Google shipped 2.53 million Pixel 2 and 2 XL devices through the nine months ended June 30, Strategy Analytics said. The first Pixel devices hit 2.4 million shipments in the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the firm said.

Limited adoption has reflected Google's hesitancy to go as wide and big in distributing and marketing the Pixel as Apple, which launched its last two iPhone line-ups in about 50 countries.

Going from a small experiment to a polished product that works in various languages and is backed by large sales, support and technical teams has been part of Google's challenge.

Last year's Pixel 2 arrived with bugs that prompted user complaints about unwanted noises during calls, a crashing camera app and an unexpected screen tint. In response, Google doubled warranties to two years.

The Pixel 3 faces continued limited sales in the United States since Google again signed an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc  that means the device will get little marketing from other carriers.

Google said it would augment distribution by opening two temporary stores in popular neighbourhoods of Chicago and New York on Oct. 18 and putting up displays at U.S. tech retailer B8ta and Goop.

Google's new smart speaker, which has a display to show visual responses to voice commands, mostly matches offerings from Amazon.com Inc  and Facebook Inc .

Unlike its competitors, Google said its Home Hub, priced at $149, does not have a video conferencing camera. Home Hub is launching in the United States, the U.K. and Australia.

The nod to privacy concerns comes as Google and other big U.S. tech companies try to bounce back from recent data breach scandals."
6,Trump Tariffs Push Small Firms to Plead for Same Relief as Apple,Yahoo,2018-10-11,0.572894,0.74644,"(Bloomberg) -- Paul Shekoski thinks he presented a good case why the weather stations and other products his company makes in China should be spared from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

Companies including Apple Inc. successfully avoided having tariffs imposed on products, and General Motors Co. and HP Inc. are among those seeking duty exclusions for goods such as the China-built Buick Envision and toner cartridges.

Besides Tuesday’s filing deadline for the initial tranche of tariffs, companies must file requests for exclusions from the $16 billion list by Dec. 18.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-tariffs-push-small-firms-080000087.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Paul Shekoski thinks he presented a good case why the weather stations and other products his company makes in China should be spared from President Donald Trump’s tariffs. As a small-scale employer, he’s not optimistic he will win.

Shekoski, chief executive of the Primex Family of Companies in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, is among the hundreds of U.S. companies filing requests by Tuesday’s deadline for exclusions from the initial round of tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. While Shekoski has testified against the duties, asked elected representatives for help and filed for exclusions on almost 80 products, he puts the odds of getting them approved at less than 10 percent.

“It’s swimming upstream,” said Shekoski, whose business employs about 200 people. “At the end of the day, we’re fairly small and not very visible, so we’re kind of caught in the process.”

Companies including Apple Inc. successfully avoided having tariffs imposed on products, and General Motors Co. and HP Inc. are among those seeking duty exclusions for goods such as the China-built Buick Envision and toner cartridges. But some smaller businesses such as Primex say they fear they lack the clout and resources to prevail, and they can’t afford to quickly switch suppliers.

Shekoski said his supply chain was built over three decades and the duties are enough to wipe out his annual profit, which would threaten the 75-year-old business.

Meanwhile Ohio-based Weastec Inc. has filed more than 60 requests for exclusions from tariffs on switches and other automotive parts it imports from a sister company in China for warehousing and just-in-time delivery to Honda and other automakers in the U.S., said Doug Ernst, senior manager of operations at the firm, which employs about 190.

The parts are made with unique tooling and manufacturing processes that only exist in China and can’t be produced in a cost-effective manner in the U.S. or any other country, Ernst said. The initial round of duties would add $635,000 in costs in the coming year, and the total with the third tranche of duties would be $4.1 million, he said.

“I hope I’m wrong, but I would think that the bigger players would get more consideration than folks like us would,’’ Ernst said. “Money talks and the big businesses get more press and economically they’re more, I guess, critical to the overall country.’’

Each request for exclusion is judged by career trade experts on the same criteria, regardless of the requester, the Office of the U.S. Office of Trade Representative said in a statement. Decisions are based on whether a product is available only from China, whether duties “would cause severe economic harm” to the company or U.S. interests, and whether the item is strategically important.

The Trump administration has imposed three rounds of tariffs, starting with 25 percent on $34 billion in goods July 6 and on $16 billion worth of products Aug. 23. A 10 percent duty on $200 billion took effect last month and is set to increase to 25 percent on Jan. 1, while Trump has threatened even more duties on top of that.

Before each tranche of tariffs, hundreds of U.S. companies and trade groups testified at public hearings seeking to avoid the duties, most unsuccessfully. The White House spared some categories of products, including those that cover the Apple Watch and AirPods as well as fitness trackers from Fitbit Inc.

Exclusions are the final chance for companies to avoid the duties. Besides Tuesday’s filing deadline for the initial tranche of tariffs, companies must file requests for exclusions from the $16 billion list by Dec. 18. While the Trump administration hasn’t put an exclusion process in place for the $200 billion list, the National Retail Federation and 120 other organizations in the Americans for Free Trade coalition have asked USTR to include one.

The USTR has begun to issue decisions, and of the more than 2,000 requests posted as of Oct. 4, 108 have been denied and 25 are being reviewed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to determine whether an exclusion can be administered, according to data published by the government.

Chicago-based Hallmark Industries Inc., which has 10 employees and supplies water pumps and motors, had four exclusion requests denied and expected that, President Henry Huang said. Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports, and granting exclusions undermines that effort, he said.

“If you exclude everything made in China, pretty much this whole tariff thing is a waste,’’ Huang said. Mike Bergmeier, president and principle owner of Shield Industries Inc. in South Hutchinson, Kansas, said he supports what the administration is trying to do but can’t afford a protracted trade war. Bergmeier said he only filed exclusion requests on his agricultural equipment parts that have never been made in the U.S. While they technically could be manufactured outside of China, the time and cost it would take isn’t practical for the company with 42 employees. “It’s not going to hurt anybody except me and my company and my employment,’’ he said. Robert Piazza, chief executive officer of California-based Price Pump Co. with 36 employees, said he doesn’t have the political pull or ability to lobby as an Apple or other large company. But he’s filed for exclusions on metal castings he imports from China because they would cost about three times as much made elsewhere, and he’s obligated to try. “I would hope that government would be objective, but I think that’s just wishful thinking,’’ Piazza said.

SAN FRANCISCO/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Apple Inc is taking control over the power-management technology at the heart of its iPhones in a $600 million deal with Dialog Semiconductor that also secures the German-listed company's role as a supplier to the U.S. tech giant.

The agreement to license technology and take on people from the Anglo-German chip designer is not only unusual, but also the largest of its kind by Apple, whose last sizeable acquisition was the $350 million purchase of Face ID creator PrimeSense in 2013.

Dialog shares surged as much as 34 percent on Thursday, their most since 2002, as the deal bought the company time to reduce its dependence on Apple - which it expects to account for three-quarters of this year's sales.

Dialog's shares had tumbled earlier this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier.

Dialog Chief Executive Jalal Bagherli told Reuters he could now lead a ""managed, smooth"" transformation of the business as Dialog seeks new opportunities in areas such as the Internet of Things that includes connected devices like home speakers, fitness trackers or smart watches.

Since the first iPhones a decade ago, Apple has used Dialog power-management chips to extend their battery life. Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, taking on a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.

Dialog said its 2018 revenue would not be affected and it would continue shipments of existing main power management integrated circuits (PMICs) to Apple. It expects to sell current and future generations of so-called sub-PMICs to Apple.

Bagherli said that Apple increasingly viewed main PMICs, which are central to the operation of its devices, as a strategic element that it wanted to control directly. This was not the case for sub-PMICs that manage features such as on-board cameras, he told Reuters.

After the deal, Dialog expects Apple to account for 35-40 percent of its total revenues in 2022. That is down from around 75 percent in the current year. Headcount will fall to 1,800.

The chipmaker also said it would begin a share buyback programme for up to 10 percent of its stock following its next quarterly trading update. The $600 million windfall will add to Dialog's already-healthy net cash position of $525 million, analysts said.

Other chip designers in Europe have struggled to manage their relationship with Apple due to its sheer scale. Britain's Imagination Technologies ended up being sold to a Chinese-backed fund last year after losing Apple as a client.

""Dialog has bought itself much more than just time,"" said Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, which rates the stock 'buy'. ""Its Apple business has been clearly defined and put on a sound long-term footing.""

Half of the deal's value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.

Dialog said it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.

It forecast that its sub-PMIC business would achieve compound annual growth rates of 30-35 percent between 2018 and 2022. Its AMS, Connectivity and Automotive & Industrial business would grow at a 10-15 percent rate.

The deal represents an expansion of Apple's chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.

Apple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog's workforce. Apple said these employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company's senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple's chip design efforts.

""Our relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this long-standing relationship with them,” Srouji said. Apple has added around 20,000 employees in Europe since 2000. It already has a chip design centres in Munich, Germany, where it employs 1,000 staff, and St Albans, Britain. The deal will give Apple four more from Dialog, in Livorno in Italy, Swindon in Britain, and Nabern and Neuaubing in Germany.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to customary closings and regulator approvals, Dialog said. It expects annual operational savings of $35 million from the deal, but declined to give more detail on its financial impact ahead of an investor presentation on Nov. 1.

Dialog said Qatalyst Partners acted as its financial adviser and Linklaters as its legal counsel."

Apple will pay Dialog an initial $300 million plus an additional $300 million for product delivery over the next few years. The British firm also won a number of new contracts from the iPhone maker, including the supply of power management, audio subsystem, charging and mixed-signal integrated circuits, according to a statement Thursday.

Dialog relies on Apple for about three-quarters of its revenue, predominantly through the supply of chips that handle charging and manage power in smartphones.

While Apple has developed its own processors for years, the company only recently stepped up the in-house design of components, including graphics, Bluetooth and other phone-related chips. That’s expensive and creates new risks, but helps maintain leverage over suppliers after a wave of acquisitions cut the number of chipmakers it works with.

Apple began using its own graphics chips, or GPUs, in the iPhone 8 and iPhone X. That continued with the recently released iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4. Apple uses technology from another U.K. chip designer -- Imagination Technologies Group Plc -- in products like the iPad and Apple TV, but is expected to eventually transition all of its iOS-based products to its own graphics processors.

Following the deal with Apple, Dialog will concentrate on businesses including the Internet of Things, mobile, automotive and computing. Apple’s new hires consist of around 16 percent of Dialog’s total workforce, and the U.S. company will also acquire Dialog facilities in Italy, U.K. and Germany.

Dialog’s 2018 revenue will not be affected by this agreement and the company will continue shipments of current products in production to Apple, the company said in the statement. Dialog will also launch a share buyback program of up to 10 percent of its outstanding shares following its third-quarter trading update.

Apple, Google and Amazon are the top three most valuable brands in the world, according to an annual report that underlines the dominance of the US tech companies.

Interbrand, which assigns a dollar value to each brand based on factors such as financial performance and brand strength, ranked Apple first in 2018 with a brand value of $214bn. In August, Apple became the first public company with a trillion dollar valuation.



Apple and Google have held the top two spots for six consecutive years, according to Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report, while Facebook slipped one place in 2018 to ninth after being the fastest growing brand for five years.

Meanwhile brands that made the top 100 in 2017 but were ejected this year included Tesla, Thomson Reuters, Moët & Chandon, and Smirnoff.



Charles Trevail, chief executive of Interbrand, said those brands that were able to respond to the changing needs and expectations of customers were the most successful. “Today we live in a world where consumers have more power than ever, curating their own personal brands in ways we’ve never seen. Brands like Amazon, Spotify and Netflix lead the way in this era by improving our lives in very personal ways.”

© getty Apple and Google have held the top two spots for six consecutive years, according to Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report. Netflix was the only one of the so-called Faang stocks – Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google – to be outside the top 10, but it is the second fastest growing brand in 2018 after making its debut in the top 100 in 2017.



“[Netflix’s] brave decision to invest in original programming in 2012 has now netted it a staggering 112 Emmy nominations, more than any network or streaming service, and its stock market value is greater than Disney,” Interbrand said.

Amazon was the fastest growing brand, because of its desire to be “the most customer-centric company on Earth”, the report added. “It has reinvented almost every sector … It revamped its Fire Phone to become the Amazon Echo smart speaker, Amazon MP3 to become streaming music service Amazon Music Unlimited, and its 2010 crowdsourcing platform for screenwriters into Amazon Studios’ Emmy Award–winning original TV shows. What’s more, according to Morgan Stanley, Amazon’s fashion business has become the second largest seller of apparel in the US.”

New entrants in the top 100 were the music streaming service Spotify, at No 92, and Subaru at 100. Re-entrants include Chanel at 23 and Nintendo at 99.

More than half of the top 100 came from five sectors – automotive, technology, financial services, luxury, and fast-moving consumer goods.

Luxury was the top performing category, with combined growth of 42%. The most valuable luxury brand in the 2018 rankings was Louis Vuitton, ranked 18 with a value of $28bn.

The most valuable British brand was HSBC, ranked 46, with a brand valued at $11bn.

Interbrand said many of the top performers were subscription based businesses, accounting for 29% of the top 100 brands. “This is because traditional notions of loyalty are eroding as we live in a service-driven economy where access is more important than ownership,” the report said.

The combined value of the top 100 was just over $2tn, according to Interbrand, up nearly 7% from 2017."

The measures are presumably there to ensure security. Apple’s proprietary chips have taken on increasing responsibilities over various functions inside the Mac, including storing secure enclave data and handling disc encryption. Especially on a day where hardware security is very much in the news, it seems reasonable to expect that Macs need to go through an Apple-approved diagnostic. But it’s also not traditionally how we like to think of PCs, which have historically not been sealed appliances. The Mac is apparently moving a little more in that direction. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tech critics and e-waste activists, however, claim that electronics makers are making devices hard to repair as a way to tightly control the repair market and encourage the purchase of new devices. Apple, alongside other hardware makers, has fought in recent years to prevent the passing of so-called right-to-repair laws that would force technology companies to make parts and instructions available to both users and third-party repair specialists.

Alipay posted a warning offering “security tips about Apple phones,” which said that it had contacted Apple many times with hope of solving the issue, according to Reuters. Tencent, which owns WeChat Pay, later confirmed similar issues in a statement to Bloomberg.

“Since Apple hasn’t resolved this issue, users who’ve linked their Apple ID to any payments method, including Alipay, WePay, or credit cards, may be vulnerable to theft,” Alipay wrote, according to Bloomberg’s translation.

It’s not stated how widespread the issue is or how much money has been lost due to the thefts. Reuters reports that a Chinese state media outlet said some losses were as high as 2,000 yuan, or about $290 USD. Apple plans to refund money that was fraudulently spent, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Though the two companies are calling out Apple, it’s not clear if the issue is specific to a flaw in its ID system. It sounds as though there has been a problem with the theft of Apple ID credentials, which thieves are then using to log in to Apple accounts and make purchases using associated payments methods, like Alipay and WeChat Pay.

An Apple spokesperson said the company encourages customers to set a strong password and enable two-factor authentication to secure their accounts.

Still, it’s unusual to see large tech companies calling one another out like this, particularly over an issue that may not be exclusive to Apple. Alipay, which comes from an Alibaba spinoff called Ant Financial, has since removed its social media post calling out Apple, though not before the story spread across and international media.

Some companies are proactive about searching out leaked account credentials, checking them against their own databases and then resetting passwords and warning users if they find a match. It’s unclear if Apple does this, but it speaks to the broader issue companies like Apple face: it’s not just their own sites and apps that need to be secure; they have to worry about common accounts and passwords being leaked from other sources as well."

Yet thousands of miles away, it dominates markets across Africa. Unknown in the West, Transsion has left global players like Samsung and Apple trailing in its wake in a continent that's home to more than a billion people.

In cities like Lagos, Nairobi and Addis Ababa, busy streets are awash with the bright blue shopfronts of Transsion's flagship brand, Tecno. In China , the company doesn't have a single store, and its towering headquarters in the southern megacity of Shenzhen goes largely unnoticed among skyscrapers bearing the names of more famous Chinese tech firms

The company took a different path to success from other top Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Xiaomi , which started out in China before eventually expanding overseas.

Transsion built its business in Africa. And it has no plans to come home.

In Edna Mall on the bustling Bole Road in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, Mesert Baru poses for her Tecno Camon i. ""This phone is seriously nice for selfies,"" says the 35-year-old shop assistant, admiring the picture she just took.

Mesert's satisfaction is no accident. Tecno cameras have been optimized for African complexions, explains Arif Chowdhury, vice president of Transsion. ""Our cameras adjust more light for darker skin, so the photograph is more beautiful,"" he says. ""That's one of the reasons we've become successful.""

Transsion founder George Zhu had spent nearly a decade traveling Africa as head of sales for another mobile phone company when he realized that selling Africans handsets made for developed markets was the wrong approach.

His timing could hardly have been better. By the mid-2000s, the Chinese government, under its ""Going Out"" strategy, was encouraging entrepreneurs to look abroad and forge stronger ties with African nations in particular. Cell phones were spreading rapidly in China, but in Africa — which has a roughly similar population — they were still a very rare luxury.

Africa, in other words, could be the new China.

Giving consumers what they want

In 2006, Zhu launched Tecno in Nigeria, targeting Africa's most populous nation first. From the start, the company's motto was ""think global, act local,"" which meant making phones that met Africans' specific needs.

""When we started doing business in Africa, we noticed people had multiple SIM cards in their wallet,"" Chowdhury says. They would awkwardly swap the cards throughout the day to avoid the steep charges operators would levy for calling different networks, says Nabila Popal, who tracks the use of devices in Africa for research firm IDC. ""They can't afford two phones,"" says Chowdhury, ""so we brought a solution to them."" Zhu made all Tecno handsets dual SIM.

More innovations followed. Transsion opened research and development centers in China, Nigeria and Kenya to work out how to better appeal to African users. Local languages such as Amharic, Hausa and Swahili were added to keyboards and phones were given a longer battery life.

Extra juice was important. In Nigeria, South Africa and Ethiopia, for example, the government frequently shuts off electricity to conserve power, leaving people unable to charge their phones for hours. In less developed markets, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chowdhury says, consumers might have to walk 30 kilometers to charge their phone at the local market -- and have to pay to do so. ""For those kind of consumers, longer battery life is a blessing,"" he adds.

Sewedo Nupowaku, the Lagos-based CEO of entertainment company Revolution Media, says he switched from a Samsung S3 to a Tecno L8 for this reason. ""I can spend 24 hours constantly talking, browsing on this phone, no problem. With a Samsung, no way.""

But perhaps Transsion's smartest move was its pricing. It has three main brands: Tecno, Infinix and Itel. Most of their feature and smartphones sell for between $15 and $200.

Mesert says she bought her Tecno smartphone for 2,000 birr ($72). At a shop near her workplace, an iPhone 7 costs the equivalent of $906, and a Samsung Galaxy J7 around $360. Average monthly wages in Ethiopia range from 1,500 birr ($54) to 3,000 ($108) birr, and most vendors across Africa don't allow customers to pay in installments.

""About 95% of Transsion smartphones cost under $200,"" says Mo Jia, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys. ""They are the king of the budget smartphone.""

In Ethiopia, Transsion went a step further to assimilate. Since 2011, every phone it sells in Africa's second most populous nation has been assembled at its facilities in the suburbs of Addis Ababa. About 700 workers piece together Shenzhen-manufactured screens, circuit boards and batteries to churn out 2,000 smartphones and 4,000 feature phones a day.

Transsion says it has a total of 10,000 local employees in Africa, and 6,000 in China. Its low-cost African workforce helps it keep down prices, according to Jia. It also adds appeal for some consumers. ""I like that my phone is made in Ethiopia,"" Mesert says.

Oye Akideinde, an amateur rapper turned software developer, was recruited by Tecno in 2015 to launch a music app called Boomplay, a homegrown rival to iTunes or Spotify. Most Nigerian internet users grew up illegally downloading music or streaming it for free on YouTube, according to Akideinde, a 40-year-old Lagos resident.

Tecno's vision was to attract music lovers by uniting African and international artists on a single platform offering affordable downloads and streaming with advertising. It preloaded the app onto every Tecno smartphone and made it the default music player. The app now has 32 million users.

Tecno spun off Boomplay and its apps division into a new company, TranssNet, last year. Backed by NetEase, a $30 billion Chinese internet company, TranssNet plans to introduce a suite of financial apps on smartphones made by Transsion.

Expanding in India and beyond

For Transsion, future growth is set to come from building its business outside Africa in other developing markets, such as Russia, Indonesia and Bangladesh. In 2017, it launched Tecno in India and within a year had claimed 5% of the huge market, according to IDC.

How did Tecno make such rapid progress? Transsion's Chowdhury says another innovation tailored to local customs has helped.

""Indian people use their hands to eat food,"" he says, ""so their fingers get oily. What if you're having lunch and your boss calls? You try to take the call but your fingerprint won't work.""

The fix: screens that can read greasy fingers."

        A report alleging that Apple and Amazon had data stolen by Chinese spies has been strongly disputed by both tech firms.
Apple and Amazon have both responded publicly to claims made by Bloomberg Businessweek which described the cyber-attack.
""There is no truth to these claims,"" said Apple's statement.
The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it had ""no reason to doubt"" Apple and Amazon's assessments.
Bloomberg has yet to respond to a BBC request for a comment about the repeated denials from Apple and others.
Earlier it said: ""We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.""
Full disclosure
Published on 4 October, Bloomberg's story alleges that Chinese spies managed to insert chips on servers made in China that could be activated once the machines were plugged in overseas. The servers were manufactured for US firm Super Micro Computer Inc.
The story suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apple were among 30 companies, as well as government agencies and departments, that used the suspect servers.
Shares in Chinese tech firms including Lenovo and ZTE fell sharply following the publication of the Bloomberg report. 
The news agency's story, which Bloomberg said resulted from a 12-month investigation, relied on unnamed and unidentified sources which, it said, included insiders at both Amazon and Apple. 
Bloomberg linked to the denials given to it by the tech firms and Super Micro Computer when it approached them with its evidence.

Apple said it had conducted ""rigorous internal investigations"" based on the evidence given to it by Bloomberg reporters and had found ""absolutely no evidence"" to support their claims.
It said: ""On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, 'hardware manipulations' or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.""
It added that it was not operating under any ""gag order"" or any other confidentiality restriction that stopped it sharing information.
Amazon published a blog that also said the spy chip story was ""untrue"" saying it had never found ""modified hardware or malicious chips"" on its systems. 
The NCSC responded to questions about the alleged spy chip attack by saying it was aware of media reports but had ""no reason to doubt the detailed assessments made by AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Apple"".
It urged anyone with ""credible intelligence"" about the allegations to get in touch."

Apparently, if the software tools are not used on key parts of the devices when conducting repairs, they might result in an “inoperative system and an incomplete repair.” 
 The warning was issued in a document distributed to Apple’s Authorized Service Providers last month, a copy of which MacRumors obtained. Unfortunately, that proprietary software is only given to authorized service providers, which are always ridiculously expensive. But because of this software, third-party service centers wouldn’t even be able to carry out some basic repairs, if they involve even shifting key parts like the display assembly and logic board out of the way, or even the trackpad for that matter.

 For iMac Pros, the software lock will kick in if you replace the logic board or flash storage and don’t run the diagnostic tool, the Apple Service Toolkit 2. Supposedly this is to ensure security, given how many tasks in the MacBook pro Apple’s chips handle. On the other hand, we do usually prefer to be able to take our computers where we like for repairs, especially if it’s nearer or cheaper than the an Apple service center.
 
 In fact, it might also just be another of Apple’s maneuvers to tighten its stranglehold on its device economy. Apple wins when you can’t get your device repaired elsewhere, because you either have to pay the price they set or buy an entirely new one. And people are automatically encouraged to do the latter when a device’s repair price is a big chunk of the tag on a new one.
 The policy hasn’t kicked in yet, but you can expect it will very soon if Apple was sending out documents."

They claim Apple, Amazon, and US government contractors were the targets. The “victims” however deny it.

 According to the report, Chinese spies had years ago infiltrated the production line of Supermicro, which manufactures server motherboards used by Apple, and Amazon Web Services, among others. At some point in production, operatives from the People’s Liberation Army (China’s military) supposedly placed tiny microchips on the motherboards, about the size of a grain of rice. These chips were equipped with processing ability, power, and connectivity, according to the piece, meaning they could spy on the activities of the companies targeted without having to crack through their software-based cybersecurity measures.
 Bloomberg alleges the operation wasn’t after user data but trade secrets, and US authorities have been investigating it for years, since Apple found the chips in 2015. However, it turns out now that all the companies involved in the investigation are denying the claims, Apple in fact offering the most vehement defense. The iPhone maker not only sent a lengthy statement to Bloomberg, but also republished it on its own site as a blog post. 
 
 “The October 8, 2018 issue of Bloomberg Businessweek incorrectly reports that Apple found ‘malicious chips’ in servers on its network in 2015,” it reads. “As Apple has repeatedly explained to Bloomberg reporters and editors over the past 12 months, there is no truth to these claims.” The company isn’t content with the simple denial either, they’ve gone out of their way to make it clear how wrong the story is.
 Apple says it’s discussed the report numerous times across multiple teams and organisations, but “no one at Apple has ever heard of this investigation.” They seem to imply Bloomberg Businessweek’s story is fabricated, as the publication won’t give them any information with which to track down the investigation or its findings.
 “No one from Apple ever reached out to the FBI about anything like this, and we have never heard from the FBI about an investigation of this kind — much less tried to restrict it,” the post continues to say. “Finally, in response to questions we have received from other news organizations since Businessweek published its story, we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.”
 
 As far as denials go, it’s a pretty strongly worded on. Obviously one of the parties here is lying through its teeth, or at least gravely misinformed.
 On the other hand, Bloomberg isn’t backing down either. The publication has put out a statement saying, “Bloomberg Businessweek‘s investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews. Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies’ full statements, as well as a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.”"

iPhone users were reporting a bug that means their devices do not charge when plugged in, with the new XS and XS Max handsets among those said to be affected.

Today the firm released a new update, iOS 12.01, to address the issue.

According to Apple's release notes for the update, it 'fixes an issue where some iPhone XS devices did not immediately charge when connected to a Lightning cable.'

The software, the first for Apple's iOS 12, also resolves an issue that could cause iPhone XS devices to rejoin a Wi-Fi network at 2.4GHz instead of 5GHz, and fixes an iPad keyboard flaw, along with Bluetooth and video subtitle bugs.

The charging bug affected Apple's new handsets, the XS and XS Max.

According to accounts on social media as well as Apple's own forums, some devices will not charge if plugged in when in 'sleep' mode, meaning the screen is off.

Some only work if the screen is turned on and the device 'woken up'.

Apple has not commented on the issue, which comes after claims from users that the new camera system in the XS and XS Max was 'beautifying' photos.

Some users have suggested the charging issue may have been caused by a security update.

As part of a software update earlier this year to combat potential hacking of Apple devices via USB, the firm introduced a feature that can disable the charging port on iPhone devices when the phone has been idle for a period of time.

The feature was introduced to prevent anyone hacking into a device without a passcode, and at the time Apple acknowledged its introduction could affect charging.

'Starting with iOS 11.4.1, if you use USB accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, or if you connect your device to a Mac or PC, you might need to unlock your device for it to recognise and use the accessory. Your accessory then remains connected, even if your device is subsequently locked,' the firm's website says.

'If you don't first unlock your password-protected iOS device — or you haven't unlocked and connected it to a USB accessory within the past hour — your iOS device won't communicate with the accessory or computer, and in some cases, it might not charge.

'You might also see an alert asking you to unlock your device to use accessories.'

Users on the official Apple forums have suggested the issue can be fixed in some cases by going to the Settings app and enabling the USB Accessories feature in the Face ID and Passcode section."

Now, Silicon Valley is reckoning with another emoji apocalypse thanks to Apple's polarizing new bagel, out in iOS 12.1 on iPhones and iPads.

The emoji depicts a plain bagel - no seeds, spread or other toppings, which sent users into an angry frenzy.

Apple's iOS 12.1 became available for users last week, introducing emoji like a lobster, romaine lettuce and a tennis ball alongside the bagel.

It didn't take long for the critics to emerge, as users began to complain that the bagel looked 'stale' or more fit to be from the 'frozen aisle from a supermarket.'

Others said that the bagel's extremely smooth exterior made it appear plastic.

New Yorkers took particular offense to the bagel emoji, with Pat Kiernan, morning news anchor at NY1 News tweeting: 'You call this factory-produced bagel an emoji that stands for all bagels??? New Yorkers demand more.'

The brouhaha even attracted the Philadelphia Cream Cheese brand, which promised to start a Change.org petition to persuade Apple to introduce a version of the bagel emoji with some schmear.

The brand tweeted: 'We think that a #BagelEmoji without cream cheese is a #SadBagel, what do you think?  started a Change.org petition that, by Monday afternoon, had received 1,005 out of 1,500 signatures.

'If we reach our goal of 30,000 signatures, we will be able to show Apple and the Unicode Consortium that the current dry, sad bagel emoji is unacceptable and needs to be updated to reflect the real thing—a bagel with a schmear of cream cheese,' the brand wrote.

Another Twitter user threatened to organize a march in New York City over the bagel gaffe.

It's unclear if Apple will add cream cheese or sesame seeds to its bagel emoji.

But as many have pointed out, emoji go through a formal process before they land on your smartphone.

They're approved by the Unicode Consortium, the body that maintains and publishes standards around emoji.

Those designs are then, typically, adopted by all the tech giants affiliated with it in uniform, like Apple and Google.

Apple also isn't the first tech firm to get caught up in an emoji scandal.

Google faced 'burgergate' last year, which centered around its controversial design of the cheeseburger.

While Apple and many other tech companies designed their cheeseburger emoji with the cheese on top of the patty, Google faced scrutiny for placing the cheese beneath the burger patty.

In response to 'burgergate', Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said he would 'drop everything' to correct this, and now Android's upcoming 8.1 release shows that he was good to his word - the emoji has been corrected.

The burger emoji debate was sparked at the end of October when Thomas Baekdal, an author from Denmark tweeted a screenshot of Apple's and Google's respective cheeseburger emojis showing the different cheese placement.

He wrote: 'I think we need to have a discussion about how Google's burger emoji is placing the cheese underneath the burger, while Apple puts it on top.'

The viral tweet caught the attention of CEO Sundar Pichai, who wrote in response on Sunday: 'Will drop everything else we are doing and address on Monday:) if folks can agree on the correct way to do this!'

The exchange between Pichai and Baekdal garnered social media jokes and suggestions.

Another wrote: 'So proud to work at a company which has it's priorities right.'

'Cheese misplacement is clearly the result of not enough diversity on the emoji team. Damn those vegetarians,' one user joked.

As seen on Emojipedia, Google is the only tech company that offers a cheeseburger emoji with cheese below the patty.

Apple, Facebook, Samsung and others all place the cheese on top."

The company's Android software has gone from being an also-ran to the brains of most of the world's smartphones, and Google topped Amazon.com Inc in smart speaker sales in recent quarters.

Pixel phones, though, have been a tougher sell, garnering less than 1 percent of the global market by shipments in Google's first two years of trying, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, and launching with glitches.

The Pixel 3, priced at $799, and larger sibling Pixel 3 XL, priced at $899, mark Google's latest entries into a phone lineup it hopes will someday be as popular as Apple Inc's iPhone.

The new Pixel Slate tablet runs Google's beefier Chrome OS laptop operating system rather than Android and is priced at $599, putting it in competition with Apple's iPad Pro tablet series.

Shares of Alphabet barely moved on the release. Financial analysts said it is difficult evaluate Google´s hardware business as it is overshadowed by profits from search ads.

Google branched into hardware three years ago so that, like Apple, it could have full control of the performance of its applications and the revenue they generate. Other phone makers sometimes crowd out Google's apps with their own or take a share of ad revenue.

Expanding geographic distribution is likely to boost Pixel's fortunes. The Pixel 3 will launch in 10 countries, up from six for the Pixel 2 a year ago. New additions include France, Ireland, Japan and Taiwan.

Also helpful could be a new artificial intelligence tool sure to generate buzz among consumers. The software, launching in the United States only, answers phone calls, requests information about the nature of the call and shares it as text with the recipient.

""We´ve built the first phone that can answer the phone,"" Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president for hardware, told media on Tuesday.

Google shipped 2.53 million Pixel 2 and 2 XL devices through the nine months ended June 30, Strategy Analytics said. The first Pixel devices hit 2.4 million shipments in the nine months ended June 30, 2017, the firm said.

Limited adoption has reflected Google's hesitancy to go as wide and big in distributing and marketing the Pixel as Apple, which launched its last two iPhone line-ups in about 50 countries.

Going from a small experiment to a polished product that works in various languages and is backed by large sales, support and technical teams has been part of Google's challenge.

Last year's Pixel 2 arrived with bugs that prompted user complaints about unwanted noises during calls, a crashing camera app and an unexpected screen tint. Google doubled warranties to two years in response.

Google Assistant, the signature virtual helper feature on the Pixel, was available in six languages a year ago and now supports 16.

In turn, Google hosted 10 unveiling events across the world on Tuesday, including in New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Singapore, spokesman Kay Oberbeck said.

Still, the Pixel 3 could see limited uptake in the United States as Google again signed an exclusive distribution deal with wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc that means the device will get little marketing from other carriers.

Google said it would augment distribution by opening on Oct. 18 two temporary stores in popular neighborhoods of Chicago and New York and putting up displays at U.S. retailers B8ta and Goop.

Google's new smart speaker, which has a display to show visual responses to voice commands, mostly matches offerings from Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.

But unlike its competitors, Google said its Home Hub, priced at $149, does not have a video conferencing camera.

The nod to privacy concerns comes as Google and other big U.S. tech companies try to bounce back from recent data breach scandals.

Amazon shipped 21.5 million smart speakers, including those with displays, in the year ended June 30, compared with 18.3 million for Google, according to research firm Canalys.

Google said in a blog post on Tuesday that it recently delivered some Google Home speakers within 10 minutes of ordering using drones from Alphabet's Project Wing.

Shares of speaker maker Sonos Inc were down 5.6 percent on Tuesday."

The National went undercover with a hidden camera to an Apple Store in Toronto to see what the employees would say about a laptop with a darkened screen. After the employee went into the back of the store to run a diagnostic he came back with a shocking price quote.

The employee said the most of the computer had been damaged with water, and therefore the customer would need to either spend $1,200 (USD $927) to fix it, or for around the same price, get a new one.

However, when the same computer was brought to a third party repair shop in New York, it took Luis Rossman at Rossman Repair Group under two-minutes to fix the darkened LCD screen by bending back a pin, and he says he would never have even charged someone for fixing it.

Despite the customer asking if the dark LCD can be fixed if water damage isn't the issue, the Genius Bar employee uses a turn of phrase, essentially saying regardless of if the screen is not damaged by water- they still need to fix the water damage- even if it is not impacting the performance

Rossman added that there were some indicator buttons that had showed there was water damage, but nothing like the Apple store employee had said which would necessitate buying an entirely new one.

Additionally, he said a computer could simply be in a damp room and end up with all of the water damage indicator buttons tagged as affected.

Apple issued a statement in response to the investigation saying their customers are best served by 'certified experts using genuine parts,' and denied grossly overestimating customers repair costs.

The investigation also delved into Apple's other 'controversial business practices including the battery/slowdown scandal.'

Additionally, The National heads to iFixit in California, which is another well known third party Apple repair shop.

There, they talk to Kyle Weins, who demonstrates the iPhone 8's battery which is glued in unnecessarily and also discussed Apple's proprietary pentalobe screw, while discussing the American Right to Repair legislation.

The investigation then returns to Toronto, where John Poole, the founder of Geekbench, who unearthed Apple's iPhone throttling of older devices, and discuss how once a new upgrade was installed customers were all experiencing slow-downs in their older iPhones.

Canadian consumer rights lawyer for Hagens Berman, Shana Scarlett, is also interviewed in California.

Scarlett was part of a class-action lawsuit against Apple, which won $450million for the company's breach of antitrust laws.

Additionally, The National delves into a Parliamentary Committee Hearing on the iPhone slowdown incident in March in Canada, where an Apple Canada lawyer came under fire.

MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith repeatedly asks the Apple lawyer 'was the non-disclosure non-intentional or was it inadvertent?' Apple responded to say it was 'non-intentional'."

Apple believes electromagnets would be particularly useful to prevent falling devices from breaking or smashing upon impact with the ground.

Apple was awarded a patent for a case that could protect youriPad or iPhone in the midst of a fall.

The patent was filed in March of 2015, but was just made public on Tuesday.

In the document, titled 'Dynamic stabilized magnetic array,' Apple describes a hi-tech gadget that uses electromagnetics to connect devices and accessories to each other.

The electromagnets would be added to the device alongside traditional magnets to provide an even stronger magnetic connection.

'Unfortunately, the fields produced by the permanent magnets are not always ideal and cannot be adapted to fit every particular situation,' Apple says in the patent.

'Furthermore, a magnetic coupling created by permanent magnets may not be strong enough to withstand certain challenging working environments in which peak forces applied to the magnetic coupling exceed the forces provided by the magnetic attraction.'

Electromagnets, meanwhile, can produce a 'substantially stronger magnetic field' than even the 'highest strength permanent magnets,' the firm added.

Apple believes electromagnets would be particularly useful to prevent falling devices from breaking or smashing upon impact with the ground.

The patent describes how the electromagnets would be powered by a magnetic field sensor in the magnetic array.

If a fall is detected, a few of the electromagnets in the case deactivate, which causes the device to be dragged away from the side that is expected to crash into the floor.

'Once corner of protective case impacts a hard surface the space between protective case and device forms a crush zone that reduces a rate at which force from the impact is imparted to device, thereby reducing a likelihood of damage,' Apple explained in the patent.

'In some embodiments, power supplied to electromagnets and can be slowly reduced to further be controlled.

'This can be particularly effective once the established crush zone has flattened and no longer has any give left as it can allow even greater control over a rate of deceleration,' the firm added.

The patent primarily describes the case as being used to protect iPads, but it's likely that it could be used for iPhones too.

Such a device would build on Apple's Smart Cover for the iPad, which uses magnets to wake and put the iPad to sleep.

It's unclear if Apple will ever release a case that prevents shattered devices, as many patented devices never come to fruition, but it's an interesting idea nonetheless."

For now, the deal settles questions about future relations between Apple and Dialog, whose shares tumbled this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier, which was widely believed to be Apple itself.

Half of the deal's value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.

Dialog said in a statement it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.

""This transaction reaffirms our long-standing relationship with Apple, and demonstrates the value of the strong business and technologies we have built at Dialog,"" Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli said in the statement.

The deal represents an expansion of Apple's chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.

Apple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog's workforce. Apple said the acquired employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company's senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple's chip design efforts.

Apple already has a chip design centres in Munich, Germany and St Albans, Britain. The deal will see Apple acquire four more from Dialog, in Livorno in Italy, Swindon in Britain, and Nabern and Neuaubing in Germany.

It is not clear how many users were affected by the breach, and Alipay's statement urged affected users to contact Apple.

The potential breach underscores the security challenges facing China's huge mobile payments market, where WeChat and Alipay services have become ubiquitous in daily life.

It also highlights the pitfalls facing tech firms in China, where smartphone scams and personal data breaches are more common than other markets.

As part of the deal, Apple will license some of Dialog's technology, bring over 300 engineers from the firm and take control of some assets.

The agreement is not only unusual, but also the largest acquisition in terms of headcount by Apple.

At times, Dialog Semiconductors has had a rocky past with Apple.   Dialog's shares had tumbled earlier this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier. The company has also suffered at times as more evidence supported that Apple would build its own in-house chips, instead of relying on suppliers.  A report last year indicated that Apple would move away from using Dialog's power management chips.   But with this deal, Dialog has secured that Apple will continue to use its chips.   Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli said he could now lead a 'managed, smooth' transformation of the business as Dialog seeks new opportunities in areas such as the Internet of Things that includes connected devices like home speakers, fitness trackers or smart watches.

Apple has had a long-standing relationship with the European firm.

Since the first iPhones a decade ago, Apple has used Dialog power-management chips to extend their battery life.

Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.

Dialog said its 2018 revenue would not be affected and it would continue shipments of existing main power management integrated circuits (PMICs) to Apple. It expects to sell current and future generations of so-called sub-PMICs to Apple.

Dialog CEO Jalal Bagherli said that Apple increasingly viewed main PMICs, which are central to the operation of its devices, as a strategic element that it wanted to control directly.

This was not the case for sub-PMICs that manage features such as on-board cameras, he told Reuters.

Other chip designers in Europe have struggled to manage their relationship with Apple due to its sheer scale. Britain's Imagination Technologies ended up being sold to a Chinese-backed fund last year after losing Apple as a client.

'Dialog has bought itself much more than just time,' said Karsten Iltgen, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, which rates the stock 'buy'.

'Its Apple business has been clearly defined and put on a sound long-term footing.'

Half of the deal's value, or about $300 million, is cash for the Dialog engineers and offices and the other $300 million is pre-payment to Dialog for supplying chips over the next three years, the companies said.

Dialog said it would continue to deliver chips to other customers, focusing on the automotive and internet-of-things markets, among others.

The deal represents an expansion of Apple's chip design operations, which kicked into high gear in 2010 when the company released its first custom processor for the iPad and iPhone.

The firm has made its own processors for several years now, but has recently stepped up its efforts to produce other components, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and Bluetooth chips, among other things.

Apple started using its own GPUs in the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, as well as the iPhone XS and the Apple Watch Series 4, according to Bloomberg.

Some experts say that the deal could be used to bolster Apple's ambitions in the virtual reality space, particularly as it relates to a VR headset.

Apple is buying about 16 percent of Dialog's workforce.

Apple said these employees would stay in Europe and would report to Johny Srouji, the company's senior vice president of hardware technologies who oversees Apple's chip design efforts.

'Our relationship with Dialog goes all the way back to the early iPhones, and we look forward to continuing this long-standing relationship with them,' Srouji said.

Apple has added around 20,000 employees in Europe since 2000.

Fans on the continent - which adopted summer schedules on Sunday - found that the Series 4 Watch struggles with the switch from Daylight Saving Time (DST).

Reports claim that a glitch in the Watches' Infograph Activity function that controls its fitness monitoring capabilities is behind the malfunction.

It has already caused their Watch to reboot and stall as it tries to process the missing hour.

UK customers may face the same issue as Britain reverts to Greenwich Mean Time on Sunday, October 28th, with the US set to adopt DST a week later on November 4th.

Currently, customers have two options if the error - which only affects the handset for the day of the time switch - happens.

They can either wait a day for the bug to auto-correct after the watch completes a full 24-hour cycle.

Alternatively, they can manually change the time and date themselves via their iPhone.

It's not yet clear whether such action may be needed when the US and UK adopt DST.

MailOnline contacted Apple for a comment on the issue, but hadn't received a response at the time of publication.

However, the company has previously been quick to correct similar flaws which affected earlier versions of iOS that caused alarm clocks to crash across Europe.

49,Apple's New Proprietary Software Locks Kill Independent Repair on New MacBook Pros,Vice,2018-10-04,0.83075,0.961204,"Apple has introduced software locks that will effectively prevent independent and third-party repair on 2018 MacBook Pro computers, according to internal Apple documents obtained by Motherboard. The new system will render the computer “inoperative” unless a proprietary Apple “system configuration” software is run after parts of the system are replaced. The computer will only begin functioning again after Apple or a member of one of Apple’s Authorized Service Provider repair program runs diagnostic software called Apple Service Toolkit 2. “For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run. Image: Apple

  This is a repair model that is similar to that used by John Deere and auto manufacturers, who often prevent owners from repairing their own tractors or cars without specific diagnostic codes or software that allow a replacement part to connect with the rest of the device.",https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/yw9qk7/macbook-pro-software-locks-prevent-independent-repair,"Apple has introduced software locks that will effectively prevent independent and third-party repair on 2018 MacBook Pro computers, according to internal Apple documents obtained by Motherboard. The new system will render the computer “inoperative” unless a proprietary Apple “system configuration” software is run after parts of the system are replaced.
  According to the document, which was distributed to Apple’s Authorized Service Providers late last month, this policy will apply to all Apple computers with the “T2” security chip, which is present in 2018 MacBook Pros as well as the iMac Pro. 
  The software lock will kick in for any repair which involves replacing a MacBook Pro’s display assembly, logic board, top case (the keyboard, touchpad, and internal housing), and Touch ID board. On iMac Pros, it will kick in if the Logic Board or flash storage are replaced. The computer will only begin functioning again after Apple or a member of one of Apple’s Authorized Service Provider repair program runs diagnostic software called Apple Service Toolkit 2.
  “For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run. Failure to perform this step will result in an inoperative system and an incomplete repair,” the document reads. MacRumors reported the new policy earlier today. 
Image: Apple

  A separate internal training presentation obtained by Motherboard about how to use the diagnostics states that the “Apple Service Toolkit and Apple Service Toolkit 2 are available only to persons working at Apple-authorized service facilities.” This means that it will become impossible for you to repair your new MacBook Pro at home, or for an independent repair provider to repair it for you. 
  The AST 2 System Configuration suite is a diagnostic software that Apple uses to ensure that the computer is functioning properly. It includes the Mac Resource Inspector, which does a “quick health check of hardware and software,” as well as tools that check the system’s memory, display, power adapters, cooling system, and other aspects of the computer. It functions only if connected to Apple’s Global Service Exchange (GSX), a Cloud-based server that Apple uses to handle repairs and service. It requires a login from Apple to access.
Image: Apple

  This is a repair model that is similar to that used by John Deere and auto manufacturers, who often prevent owners from repairing their own tractors or cars without specific diagnostic codes or software that allow a replacement part to connect with the rest of the device. Apple took a similar tact with Touch ID on recent iPhones—the Touch ID feature would not work with replacement home buttons until it went through a so-called “Horizon Machine,” which Apple uses to re-map a new Touch ID button with the old device. 
  But this move goes further than that, effectively preventing most independent repairs on new MacBook Pros. 
Image: Apple

  “There’s two possible explanations: This is a continued campaign of obsolescence and they want to control the ecosystem and bring all repair into the network they control,” Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, told me on the phone. “Another is security, but I don’t see a security model that doesn’t trust the owner of the device making much sense.”
  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
  Currently, 19 states are considering so-called “Right to Repair” legislation that would require device manufacturers to make repair parts, tools, repair guides, and diagnostic software available to the public. Apple is fighting this legislation; public records show that Apple is lobbying against the bill in New York, where lobbying records must be disclosed to the public.
  Wiens said that, currently, there is a thriving independent market for MacBook repair, and that this move fundamentally threatens many small businesses and, down the line, may impact school districts, which often have to repair computers used in classrooms at scale. Not everyone lives near an Apple Store or authorized service provider, so it may also make repair much less accessible for people living in underserved areas.
  “This is a portion of the ecosystem that has been very healthy. Independent repair companies have been fixing MacBooks undaunted by the user-hostile activities Apple has taken,” Wiens said. “It could be really detrimental to schools, to people who live in rural areas. If they stick with this, it seems like a huge argument in favor of right to repair.”"

On Thursday morning, Bloomberg Businessweek published a bombshell investigation. The report — the result of more than a year of reporting and over 100 interviews with intelligence and company sources — alleged that Chinese spies compromised and infiltrated almost 30 U.S. companies including Apple and Amazon by embedding a tiny microchip inside company servers.






      
        
        


  
    
    
      “We tried to figure out if there was anything, anything, that transpired that's even remotely close to this. We found nothing.” 
    

    
    


      
        
        


  
  





According to Bloomberg’s reporting, an attack of this caliber isn’t just elaborate but “the most significant supply chain attack known to have been carried out against American companies.” The security ramifications for the businesses (and consequently millions of Americans) are likely dizzying.
Both Amazon and Apple issued uncharacteristically strong and detailed denials of Bloomberg’s claims.
Reached by BuzzFeed News multiple Apple sources — three of them very senior executives who work on the security and legal teams — said that they are at a loss as to how to explain the allegations. These people described a massive, granular, and siloed investigation into not just the claims made in the story, but into unrelated incidents that might have inspired them.
“We tried to figure out if there was anything, anything, that transpired that's even remotely close to this,” a senior Apple security executive told BuzzFeed News. “We found nothing.”
A senior security engineer directly involved in Apple’s internal investigation described it as “endoscopic,” noting they had never seen a chip like the one described in the story, let alone found one. “I don’t know if something like this even exists,” this person said, noting that Apple was not provided with a malicious chip or motherboard to examine. ""We were given nothing. No hardware. No chips. No emails.""
Equally puzzling to Apple execs is the assertion that it was party to an FBI investigation — Bloomberg wrote that Apple “reported the incident to the FBI."" A senior Apple legal official told BuzzFeed News the company had not contacted the FBI, nor had it been contacted by the FBI, the CIA, the NSA or any government agency in regards to the incidents described in the Bloomberg report. This person’s purview and responsibilities are of such a high level that it’s unlikely they would not have been aware of government outreach.
Reached for comment, Apple directed BuzzFeed News to its Thursday blog post.
Apple’s broad, categorical denial is essentially unprecedented in its detail. For example, when the Washington Post revealed the government's PRISM program in 2013, Apple, Google and Facebook all issued very precise denials noting that none gave government agencies ""direct access to our servers."" In this case, however, Apple’s statement leaves little room for interpretation or alternate explanations. Apple not only denies the direct claims about its involvement with the FBI, but goes further to deny that ""anything like this"" happened. It went on to state that ""we are not under any kind of gag order or other confidentiality obligations.""
Bloomberg’s defense of its story is equally forceful. On Friday, the publication stood by its reporting. ""Bloomberg Businessweek's investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews,"" a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in response to a series of questions. ""Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies' full statements, as well as a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.""
The result is an unusual stalemate that’s left onlookers baffled.






      
        
        


  
  





The story has clearly rattled Apple, a notoriously private company, and one that has long touted its strong commitment to privacy. Sources say the company’s infosec team is aghast at its allegations. “This did not happen,” a senior Apple security executive told BuzzFeed News. This person insisted, vehemently, that there is no dissembling in the company’s response, that it didn’t secretly remove compromised servers, or discover compromised servers during the acceptance process and stop short of deploying them. “We have literally seen nothing like this.”
Particularly vexing for Apple, say company sources, is the suggestion it might be lying to the public to protect national security interests. The company has said on record that it is under no gag order, but Congress has on occasion granted retroactive immunity to companies aiding U.S. intelligence efforts. However, a senior Apple legal official who spoke with BuzzFeed News said the company is bound by no confidentiality order or agreement. “We are not restrained in any way,” this executive said. Asked point blank if Apple is lying to the public in the interests of national security, this executive replied, ""no.""
For Apple, the investigation into the Bloomberg allegations appears to be over. Multiple sources tell BuzzFeed News that the company believes it’s done everything it can, pulled all the threads, talked to everyone and examined every corner of its business. It’s reached a what-else-can-we-do impasse.
What happens next isn’t exactly clear. Those with a vested interest — security professionals, government officials, and Amazon and Apple’s millions of customers — are left with questions that are currently unanswerable as Bloomberg and the subjects of its story continue to square off."
