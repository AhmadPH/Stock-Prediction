Two of the largest and most powerful brands in the world, Volkswagen and Microsoft, have announced a partnership. VW will team up with the American tech giant in order to develop new digital services for the brand’s owners, fleet managers and dealers.

Microsoft’s ‘Azure’ software will be used to develop cloud-based connectivity services. The technology will be limited to Volkswagen initially, but will spread to other vehicles in the group’s range, including those from Audi, Seat, and Skoda and even Bugatti and Bentley.

The pair will create the Volkswagen Automotive Cloud, a proprietary system that will bring live digital services into cars such as in-car telematics, online entertainment and live traffic data. It’s expected to form a major part of the brand’s upcoming I.D. family of electric cars, providing data on charging points and planning routes around electric chargers.

The partnership will also aid Volkswagen in its plan to become a ‘mobility provider’ rather than a mere car company – with ride sharing, autonomous driving and the Volkswagen ‘We’ digital platform all encompassed.

VW promises that by 2020, there will be more than 5 million of its vehicles on the roads with online connectivity – tied into the IoT (Internet of Things) in the cloud.

As part of the agreement with Microsoft, Volkswagen will establish a new digital office in North America, close to the computing giant’s HQ. This will enable VW to work closely with Microsoft on these digital systems. Around 300 workers will be employed there."

Shoppers say they prefer to buy toys on Amazon, according to a recent consumer survey by Stifel Financial. They also prefer to buy electronics, jewelry, and sports apparel with the online retailer.

That's four top categories for holiday shopping where customers all prefer to go online to Amazon instead of shopping in store.

The survey was conducted by asking thousands of shoppers what they purchase at Walmart, Target, and Costco and what they prefer to buy online on Amazon.

It's not a good sign for America's largest store chains as they head into the holiday season. Toys are an especially important thing to watch this year, as the category will be hotly contested as retailers fight for a piece of the billions Toys R Us did in sales in 2017.

Analysts are already forecasting a good holiday for retailers, with most overall sales growth estimates in the high single or low double digits. But it's even better news for e-commerce players like Amazon.

Google approached advertising agencies and invited them to build comparison shopping sites.

It also offered substantial incentives to retailers to generate interest in the scheme.

The search firm then showed the names of the new sites under the images in its Google Shopping advertising insert, giving the impression of a thriving comparison shopping marketplace.

However, Google-certified operators told Sky News their sites were not designed to be used for shopping, with one calling it ""an advertising system that looks like a price comparison"".

As part of Google's CSS scheme, ad firm Shoptimised operates a site called High Street One, which at first glance resembles a traditional price comparison site.

Shoptimised co-founder, John Cave, said the site was never intended for consumers.

""High Street One is not designed for people to come on and shop,"" he said. ""It's literally a website set up so people such as ourselves can pass on benefits to agencies and retailers.""

Asked if that made the CSSs ""fake"", Mr Cave replied: ""You could call them that, yes.""

Richard Wyatt, managing director of another Google CSS partner, Onefeed, said his comparison shopping service was ""a means of getting a rebate.""

He added: ""I don't think it's got anything to do with shopping sites for customers.""

A Google spokesperson said: ""Google Shopping complies with the European Commission's order - we give all comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show ads from merchants on Google's search results page as we give to Google shopping.""

Since Google launched its comparison shopping service scheme, more than 90 sites have joined the scheme, with more than 60 in the United Kingdom.

Like High Street One, the majority are run by advertising firms, channelling advertisements from retailers into the Google Shopping box.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing but consumer experts have raised concerns that many of the Google-certified sites do not make it clear to users how they make their money.

""If you have a comparison site that's run by an advertising agency patently using only its clients, that's not even slightly a comparison site in any sense,"" says Jasmine Birtles, founder of Money Magpie, who also criticised the sites' rudimentary functionality, calling it ""a nonsense"".

Google has laid out some specifications for its partners, including offering ""sorting or filtering"" and a method of searching.

Yet Sky News found sites freezing or crashing, offering a small range of products (often including the most random items even in a targeted search).

Despite Google's stipulations, many also had no method of filtering.

The CSS scheme is Google's second attempt to foster diversity in its Google Shopping box.

In September 2017, three months after the commission's verdict, Google announced that it would allow rivals to bid against its own service in the auction for advertising slots on Google Shopping, the insert it shows at the top of product searches.

However, several companies with knowledge of the scheme told Sky News that take-up from price comparison sites was poor.

So, from June 2018, Google began approaching ad agencies and inviting them to build comparison shopping sites.

The search firm offered retailers a monthly rebate of £32,000 if they advertised through a CSS.

It also gave discounts of up to 20% on the rates of ads passed through a CSS, which one CSS operator told Sky News could be worth as much as £200,000 to large advertisers.

CSS operators could charge for access to their site, or ask clients to pay a management fee, for instance by taking a percentage of the rebate.

With (Other OTC: WWTH - news) demand from retailers high, some ad agencies also joined the scheme in order to keep existing clients."

The third quarter is, however, expected to mark a peak in earnings as a two-year super cycle of tight supply and soaring demand comes to an end, with prices of some types of chips already sliding sharply.

Samsung, in a regulatory filing, said July-September profit was likely 17.5 trillion won ($15.5 billion), up 20.4 percent from the same period a year earlier. That compared with an average forecast of 17.2 trillion won in a Refinitiv poll of 15 analysts.

The firm did not elaborate on its performance and will disclose detailed earnings in late October.

The cashierless supermarkets use technology to allow customers to pick up items and walk out with them, instead, charging their Amazon account so they don't have to stand in a checkout queue.

According to The Sunday Times, the retailer is looking for “a significant number” of sites sized between 4,000 sq ft and 5,000 sq ft across the UK.

Amazon initially launched the concept back in 2016, allowing Amazon staff to trial the new technology. Since then, it has opened five stores in the US across Seattle and Chicago.

Customers download an Amazon Go app before entering the store. They have to use the app to enter the store, which registers their Amazon account, and then they can put their phone away and start shopping.

Amazon’s “Just Walk Out Technology” uses computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning to detect when products are taken off a shelf, or later returned.

The technology keeps track of all the items in a virtual cart so there is no scanning involved. Once customers are done shopping they can leave the store and Amazon will charge your account.

It was only a matter of time before it brought the Amazon Go brand to the UK. The company filed several trademarks with the UK Intellectual Property Office last year, including slogans such as “No Lines. No Checkout. (No Seriously.)” This slogan appeared on Amazon’s YouTube video initially promoting the store

In 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the technology faced problems when there were more than 20 people in the store, something Amazon has been working to correct and, as a result, has delayed the expected roll out of further locations.

At the moment, it’s unlikely that Amazon Go will arrive to compete with your local Tesco or Sainsbury’s. The stores stock ready-to-eat items for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with some grocery essential ranges too, however, stock varies depending on which store you are in.

But, when it does arrive in the UK, it will no doubt be celebrated by busy Londoners. The idea of being able to pick up some lunch and walk out of the door without queueing is a dreamy one, we admit."

NEW YORK (AP) -- Google is expected to introduce two new smartphones Tuesday, part of its continuing push to embed its digital services and Android software more deeply into peoples' lives.

The new Pixel-branded phones will anchor a product event Tuesday in New York. Google launched its line of high-end phones two years ago to better compete against Apple, Samsung and other device makers. That includes many that rely on free software and apps such as the free Android operating system, which powers most of the world's mobile devices, as well as Google's search engine, Google Maps and YouTube.

Google is also likely to roll out several other gadgets, including new version of its ""smart"" Home speaker, a rumored tablet with a detachable keyboard and an update to its Chromecast streaming device, based on media leaks.

The latest Pixel phones are likely to attract the most attention, even though the first two generations have so far barely made a dent in the market. Google has sold an estimated 7 million Pixels over the past two years, almost imperceptible next to the 3.6 billion phones shipped during that time, according to the research firm International Data Corp.

Google doesn't disclose its phone shipments, unlike Apple, which has sold about 388 million iPhones since the first Pixel came out in October 2016.

""If you have a Google tattoo on you, then these are the phones for you,"" IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said of the Pixel's limited appeal so far.

Google has been somewhat restrained in its distribution and marketing the Pixel phone, Llamas said, because it doesn't want to alienate Samsung and hundreds of other device makers who feature Android in their own phones. Because Android highlights Google services, it's key to Google's business of selling ads through its search engine and other mobile apps.

The iPhone also features Google's search engine, but Google may be paying Apple as much as $9 billion annually for that privilege, based on the estimates of Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall.

The new Pixel phones are expected to follow the trend of expanding the phone screen nearly to the edges of the device. Apple, for instance, just released its biggest iPhone yet, the XS Max, which sells for as much as $1,450. Google hasn't yet discussed prices for its Pixel phones.

Analysts are also expecting Google to add higher resolution and more cameras to the Pixel, whose first two generations attracted rave reviews for its high-quality pictures."

The firm set up by former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May to produce their big budget Amazon motoring show The Grand Tour made more than £7m in profits last year – and paid almost the same UK tax bill as the digital giant.

In 2015, the trio and executive producer Andy Wilman signed a three-series deal to create a rival to the BBC2 motoring show for a reported £160m.

The third series of the show – one of Amazon’s biggest hits and driver of subscribers to its Prime video subscription service – is due to be shown later this year.

Chump Holdings, the company set up to produce The Grand Tour, reported a pre-tax profit of £7.6m last year. Chump paid a UK corporation tax bill of £1.5m.

Amazon, which is on the brink of a $1tn (£765bn) stock market valuation, had a UK corporation bill of £4.5m last year. However, tax credits and deferrals from previous years meant the company, which has been strongly criticised for the amount of tax it pays in the UK, ultimately paid just £1.7m tax on its profits to HMRC.

Earlier this month, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said he would introduce a “digital services tax” – primarily targeting Google and Facebook – while the chief executive of Tesco has called for an “Amazon tax” on online sales to address the failure to properly tax the digital giants.

Facebook UK’s most recent accounts made public over the weekend show that its corporation tax bill jumped from £5.1m to £15.8m as revenues surged almost 50% to £1.26bn and profits climbed to £62m.

Chump Holdings’ four directors took home £5.2m in remuneration and fees for “presenting services”, which equates to £1.3m each.

The company accounts show turnover, listed as “television production”, was £26m last year, which relates to the terms of Amazon’s commissioning agreement for each series.

The company paid just over £3m in wages and salaries to its 27 production and administration staff last year.

“The directors are keen to continue focusing on producing quality programming whilst ensuring that the company’s overheads are kept stable,” Clarkson and his fellow directors said in the financial filing. “The directors are satisfied with the results for the year and the financial position at the year end and will continue to pursue business opportunities as they arise in the future.”"

The Google Pixel 3 and the Google Pixel 3 XL are set to be unveiled on Tuesday, 9 October, however tech bloggers spotted an XL device for sale in Hong Kong.

The 6.3-inch smartphone features 128GB of internal storage space, 4GB of RAM, wireless charging, and a screen resolution of 2,960 x 1,440 pixels – as well as a notch at the top of the screen.

The phone also features Google's latest Android 9.0 mobile operating system, known as Android Pie.

The inclusion of wireless charging is part of an industry-wide shift towards the technology, according to industry experts.

“Google was an early adopter of wireless charging in its Nexus series, but integrating the technology into its flagship product signifies something much bigger - the tech giant’s commitment to a wireless world,"" said Dan Bladen, CEO of wireless power firm Chargifi.

""Both Apple and Google have fuelled the demand for ubiquitous wireless charging this Autumn– a trend that is set to continue as competitors bring new products to the market.""

Samsung is also rumoured to be introducing wireless charging to its mid-range selection of smartphones before its higher-end devices.

It is not the first time one of the devices has been spotted in the wild. Last month, a driver of the Lyft ride-hailing service discovered a high-end Android device that had all the hallmarks of being the next flagship Google Pixel.

The leaked images shared by the Lyft driver revealed that Google is planning a dual-lens camera at the front of the device – presumably for improved selfies.

The rear camera, however, bucks the trend of other high-end smartphones by sticking with a single-lens setup."

NEW YORK (AP) -- The Latest on Google's new Pixel phones (all times local):

Google's new Pixel phones will mirror the industry trend moving the devices toward lusher and bigger screens, coupled with more fine-tuning of the cameras for better selfies and other pictures.

The Pixel phones unveiled Tuesday in New York come in two different sizes, but both feature high-definition screens that span from one edge to another. It's the first time that Google has embraced a format that Apple adopted last year with the iPhone X.

The Pixel 3 will be available Oct. 18 and sell at prices starting at $799. That's $200 below the least expensive iPhone XS that came out last month.

Google also introduced a new device called Home Hub that pairs a small display screen with an internet-connected speaker. That's similar to Amazon's Echo Show and a new Facebook device called Portal. The Home Hub will sell for $149, undercutting the Show and Portal.

Google is expected to introduce two new smartphones Tuesday, part of its continuing push to embed its digital services and Android software more deeply into peoples' lives.

The new Pixel-branded phones will anchor a product event Tuesday in New York. Google launched its line of high-end phones two years ago to better compete against Apple, Samsung and other device makers.

Most phone makers besides Apple rely heavily on Google software — both its free Android operating system, which powers most of the world's mobile devices, and other apps such as search, Google Maps and YouTube.

Google's own Pixel phones, however, have so far tended to generate more media attention than consumer sales."

In an email to AFP, Google spokesman Al Verney confirmed that ""we have now filed our appeal of the European Commission's Android decision at the General Court of the European Union.""

In its July decision, Brussels accused Google of using the Android system's huge popularity on smartphones and tablets to promote the use of its own Google search engine and shut out rivals.

EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager ordered Google to ""put an effective end to this conduct within 90 days or face penalty payments"" of up to five percent of its average daily turnover.

The sanction nearly doubled the previous record EU antitrust fine of 2.4 billion euros, which also targeted Google, in that case for the Silicon Valley titan's shopping comparison service in 2017.

Google provides Android free to smartphone manufacturers and generates most of its revenue from selling advertisements that appear along with search results.

But Vestager said Google had shut out rivals by forcing major phone makers including South Korea's Samsung and China's Huawei to pre-install its search engine and Google Chrome browser.

They were also made to set Google Search as the default, as a condition of licensing some Google apps. As a result, Google Search and Chrome are pre-installed on the ""significant majority"" of devices sold in the EU, the European Commission says.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai in July refuted the accusations arguing that the decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with Apple phones that run on iOS with their own pre-installed apps.

The EU decision ""rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less,"" Pichai added in a blog post.

But according to industry-tracker Gartner, Android dominated the smartphone market with a share of 85.9 percent last year, to around 14 percent for Apple's iOS.

Some 1.3 billion Android smartphones were sold last year, compared with approximately 215 million running on iOS and 1.5 million with other operating systems, according to the research firm.

The appeal could take years to snake its way through the EU court system."

At a packed event in London, the company unveiled its latest product range including the much-anticipated Google Pixel 3 phone, a brand new Pixel tablet and some new Google Assistant products.

But we all know what you really care about is the exciting new phones, with a distinct new 'not pink' colour coming to the range.

Here's what you need to know about the new Pixel 3 smartphones.

The Google Pixel 3 has had a big screen update, going up to 5.5-inches, from 5-inches on last year's phone, and the headphone jack has finally been retired. Wireless charging has been added, and the phone promises to be one of the best camera phones out there thanks to some new AI enhancements.

There’s a new colour this year too, in the form of the “not pink”.

The new phone has an OLED HDR screen, like the new iPhone XS range, and it has a thin bezel at the top of the phone. No notch for the smaller Pixel 3.

Battery size, the phone has a 2,915 mAh battery, slightly bigger than the previous phone but still not that big compared to other devices on the market. However, Google promises seven hours of usage for 15 minutes of charging, which sounds pretty decent.

Wireless charging comes courtesy of a new glass back, protected by Gorilla Glass 5.

There's no hardware update coming to the camera this year. There’s one single lens on the back, 12.2-megapixels, but it has undergone a massive improvement on the software side. Google has gone to town on its AI system, including a feature that makes sure that everyone in the photo is smiling and has their eyes open. This is what we want from our cameras.

Inside the phone is powered by Snapdragon 845 chipset, with 4GB of RAM and either 64GB or 128GB of memory.

The new Pixel 3 will be released in Europe on November 2, with prices starting from £739.

There’s not that much change from last year’s phone, but like with all things Google, it’s all about the software. Those new camera features look great and the bigger screen will make people happy too.

The Google Pixel 3’s bigger sibling, coming in at a sizeable 6.3inches and that notorious notch, something Google has shunned before. There’s a second front-facing camera, and wireless charging, and inside the phone runs on Android Pie out of the box.

There’s that new OLED HDR screen, like the smaller Pixel, with a Gorilla Glass 5-protected glass back. Inside, the phone is also powered by Snapdragon 845, and the same RAM and memory storage as the other phone. It has a bigger battery though, which we’d expect for the size, going up to 3,430mAh. The camera is the same as last year’s Google Pixel 2, but with those software updates. One AI application is Super Res Zoom, to enhance your digital zoom. It also has an IP68 water rating, though we’d expect nothing less now as this is what most smartphones come with. The Google Pixel 3 XL has the same release date as the Pixel 3, November 2, with prices starting at £869. That’s around the same price as the Samsung Note 9, and looks a whole lot better, and a lot cheaper than the iPhone XS Max. The Google Pixel 3 XL has had more design upgrades than the Pixel 3, adding in the notch by minimising the bezels, and updating the screen to 6.3-inches. Those camera features will surely keep Google Pixel as the best camera smartphone on the market and Google Pie is going to be pretty good too."

NEW YORK (AP) -- Amazon's plans to pay all its U.S. employees at least $15 an hour is putting pressure on small business owners, even those who aren't retailers directly competing with the huge company.

""Amazon is giving a kick in the butt to a lot of business owners to increase compensation,"" says Gene Marks, owner of The Marks Group, a small business consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Small businesses located near Amazon's dozens of order fulfillment centers vie with the company for staffers, and the competition will become even fiercer during the upcoming holiday season, when Amazon needs an extra 100,000 people to pack and ship boxes.

Amazon is ""doing what they need to do to get employees,"" Marks says.

The company, whose market value briefly topped $1 trillion last month, has another motive — placating critics including some politicians who have called on Amazon to give its employees a raise.

The strong economy and shrinking labor pool has made workers hard to find for employers of all kinds, including big retail chains, fast-food restaurants and small businesses. Some are boosting pay. But higher wages are harder for small businesses to absorb because they don't have the massive revenue stream of a company like Amazon.

Meanwhile, small retailers who sell on Amazon expect the internet giant to increase the fees it charges them to help fund the salary increases. But small business consultants, and owners themselves, say strategizing can help lessen the pain.

Here are three things small business owners need to know about Amazon's wage hike:

A small business can be more flexible than a huge company. So, while small businesses may not be able to match Amazon's pay, they can sweeten the pot for potential hires and their current employees in other ways.

Owners should say to prospective employees, ""we may have a little difficulty giving you the full $15, but what else can we do for you,"" says Brent Leary, co-founder of CRM Essentials, a consulting firm.

With fewer workers to juggle, small businesses can more easily offer flexible schedules, transportation or other perks that might make up for slightly lower pay. And companies that employ people in their 20s and 30s find that many of their staffers would prefer more benefits to extra pay.

Small businesses can also be better at giving younger people training and mentoring, even during a short-term hire.

""If you provide a work experience that they're looking for, that makes it easier to find people,"" Leary says.

RAISING PRICES MAY NOT SCARE CUSTOMERS AWAY

Some small business owners may have to pass along the higher costs of competing with Amazon or selling through its website to their customers. Many owners dread having to charge more but they should realize that consumers and businesses are likely to be more accepting of higher prices now that the economy is strong, Marks says.

Moreover, ""if you have to increase your prices, your competition probably has to also,"" Marks says.

Companies that have to raise prices should be up-front with customers about why it's happening, Leary says. That will help preserve a good relationship with their customers.

Amazon stokes goodwill of its own by offering customers same-day or even one-hour delivery. Still, retailers have the ability to differentiate themselves, says John Lawson, an online marketing consultant.

""Amazon doesn't necessarily have the most personalized service,"" he says.

Lawson finds that more consumers are interested in ordering online and picking up merchandise in stores; any brick-and-mortar retailer that can offer that service should, he says.

GoVacuum.com, which sells on Amazon as well as its own website, believes the fees it pays the company for taking orders and packing and shipping merchandise will go up as a result of the higher wages. But GoVacuum.com Vice President Justin Haver says the increase is a cost of doing business, and a change the Chantilly, Virginia, company will take in stride.

""The reality is, selling online and running a business requires forward thinking and nimble adaptation to current trends/opportunities,"" Haver says.

Many owners may look for cost savings elsewhere in their company, perhaps finding cheaper supplies or lower shipping costs."

Amazon today admitted it had made an awkward discovery about its Artificial Intelligence hiring process - the computer does not like women.

The AI, brought in in 2014, was supposed to revolutionise, among other things, the hiring of staff by big firms with a computer programme sorting through hundreds of CVs and finding the best five.

But the tech giant said the failure came after AI based its conclusions on the pattern of CVs submitted to the company over 10 years. Since most came from men, the computer learned those applications were better, it emerged today.

CVs that even included the word “women” were penalised. Graduates of all-women colleges were downgraded. The retail giant disbanded its AI recruitment team last year as executives realised the flaws could not be fixed.

Amazon’s hiring tool reportedly used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars, much like shoppers rate products on Amazon.

A source told Reuters: “Everyone wanted this holy grail. They literally wanted it to be an engine where I’m going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we’ll hire those.”

According to surveys, more than half of US human resources managers expect AI to be a regular part of their work in the near future.

Amazon says it now only uses a “much-watered-down version” of the AI recruiter."

But now Samsung has one-upped Huawei with a new smartphone with four rear lenses - and it’s not even a flagship phone.

The new Samsung A9 is part of Samsung’s A range, it’s mid-range smartphones, meaning the pricing is pretty affordable. The A9 will will cost £549 when it goes on sale, putting it on a competitive level with OnePlus.

The four cameras include an 8-megapixel, 120-degree ultra wide angle lens, a 10-megapixel telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom, a main lens that comes in at 24-megapixels and a 5-megapixel depth camera with live focus. (This is the part of the camera that gives you that bokeh effect in portrait mode.)

Samsung says its aware customers purchase smartphones based on their photographic capabilities, and therefore wants to make sure each gets the best device for their budget.

“We’re not restricting our innovation and development just to the flagship range,” Kate Beaumont, Samsung’s director of product, services and commercial strategy, told the Standard. “We’re starting to bring technology and experiences right through the range of devices.”

But might four cameras be a tiny bit excessive?

“Phones used to be about voice, then messaging, and now it’s about communicating through photos,” says Beaumont.

Set to launch in November, as well as the flashy cameras, the A9 has a 6.38-inch display, comes with Qualcomm’s 660 processor and a 3,800mAh battery - a bigger battery than the new Google Pixel 3 phone.

It will ship in three colours - black, blue, and bubblegum pink - and as it's aimed at the Instagram generation, will boast a whopping 128GB of storage too.

And that is not all the A9 has to offer. Beaumont says other high-end features from the flagship range include Samsung Pay and Samsung Health - because with the A9 it's not just about hardware upgrades, but also, software upgrades.

Many might ask why Samsung are releasing more devices - devices at a lower price point, no less - when it only launched the new Note 9 two months ago. Turns out, the mid-range smartphone market is really growing, up 46 per cent year-on-year, thanks to the growth of companies like OnePlus and Huawei’s Lite range.

In view of which, Samsung has expanded its A series and J series from four devices in 2017 to a total of seven this year.

“It’s important to give people more choice,” says Beaumont. ""It's also an interesting part of the market dynamic - if they have that choice, then we need to make sure that the devices we're creating have the right feature sets to win the hearts and minds.”

Samsung has doubled down on the dual-lens smartphone camera trend by placing an array of four separate lenses on the back of its latest device.

The Samsung Galaxy A9, set to be released at some point next month, is designed with social media in mind, with the South Korean firm saying it is ""optimised for the Instagram generation.""

At £549, the mid-range smartphone sits below the Galaxy S9 and Note 9 phones, and puts it in competition with the similarly-priced OnePlus 6 and Honor 10.

The four-camera setup may be eye-catching in an increasingly crowded market, but it comes just two days after Google also bucked the dual-lens trend by deciding to stick with just a single lens for the highly-impressive camera on its Pixel 3.

Alongside its 24 megapixel main lens, the Galaxy A9's so-called Quad Camera comes with a lens for zooming, a lens for capturing wide angles and a lens to enhance the photos' depth of field.

There is also, of course, a front-facing camera that makes up for its lack of multiple lenses by cramming in a 24 megapixel sensor.

“As a global leader in smartphone innovation, we understand the demand for meaningful innovation in a fast-paced world driven by visual communication,” said DJ Koh, President and CEO of IT & Mobile Communications Division at Samsung.

“Building on our legacy in smartphone camera development we’re introducing next-generation technology across our entire Galaxy portfolio to give more consumers the opportunity to experience cutting-edge innovation. We’re excited to deliver on this promise and debut world leading smartphone camera technology with the Galaxy A9.”

The phone also features a 6.3-inch screen, 6GB of RAM, a 3,800mAh battery, 128GB of internal storage and 512GB of expandable memory."

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian online retailer Flipkart, owned by Walmart Inc, expects bumper sales during the annual festive season that just kicked off, as it boasts that U.S. rival Amazon Inc is losing relevance in India.

Flipkart and Amazon both began their flagship annual sales in India on Wednesday, and will compete for shoppers during the October-December festive season when most big-ticket purchases are made in the country.

""Flipkart is expecting a big spike in (its) 'Big Billion Days' sales over last year,"" its Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy told reporters at the e-commerce company's Bengaluru-headquarters late on Wednesday, referring to Flipkart's annual sale.

Company executives said Flipkart's deeper push into India's small towns and cities, its range of cheap, high-quality private label products and the wide assortment of smartphones will boost its sales during this year's event.

The 'Big Billion Days' sale will go on until Oct. 14, while Amazon's rival sale dubbed the 'Great Indian Festival' will finish on Oct. 15, according to its website.

Krishnamurthy said Flipkart is not worried about its rival stealing customers.

""Do we worry about them? On a scale of 0 to 10, it is close to 0 today. We don't see that much of relevance for the Indian user coming from our competition today,"" Krishnamurthy said. ""We see them as becoming a global platform for premium Indian books and home goods buyers.""

The two companies have been locked in a pitched battle to gain share in India's burgeoning e-commerce market, which is tipped to grow to be worth $200 billion a year in a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.

Flipkart launched in India in 2007, while Amazon only made a full foray into the country in 2014. Still, Amazon has gained ground rapidly, winning over tens of millions of Indian customers with its Prime loyalty program, which gives users early access to deals during sales as well free music and video streaming.

The rivalry has intensified this year after Amazon's U.S. rival Walmart bought a 77 percent stake in Flipkart for $16 billion.

Krishnamurthy said Flipkart is competing by making its range of products more affordable for Indian buyers through financing options, trade-in programs and its own private label brands.

Smartphones will be Flipkart's biggest selling category this year, but the online marketplace's dependence on phones to bulk up sales has fallen as sales in other categories have risen, he said.

The online retailer expects to sell half of all smartphones sold in India during the festive season."

He opened the group's first department store, in Chicago, in 1925 and, over time, the stores became more important than the mail order business. Gordon Weil, author of Sears, Roebuck, USA, told the Wall Street Journal this week: ""At a time when the country was going through the Great Depression, struggling to establish a sense of identity, [Sears] created a sense of security and reliability. It was one of the first retailers anywhere to introduce the concept of ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back"" and its slogans, which also included ""Sears Has Everything"", helped create a common sense of purpose among American consumers at a time when US society was a lot more egalitarian. According to Mr Weil, Sears was also late to realise the importance of the power of discounting, as practised by rivals like Kmart and Walmart, to become ""just another store"", but that is only part of the story.",https://uk.news.yahoo.com/sears-just-happened-amazon-yesteryear-125900294.html,"It was, until being overtaken by Walmart in 1989, America's largest retailer - a pioneer in mail order.

As the US became the world's most prosperous economy, attracting millions of migrants at the beginning of the 20th century, it was the company that more than any other helped them fulfil the American dream of a home full of up-to-date gadgets and modern home furnishings.

At its peak, its sales were equivalent to 1% of US gross national product.

Yet now Sears is fighting for its life.

The company, which still has 886 stores across the US, is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection ahead of a key $134m (£102m) debt repayment due on Monday.

The store chain which had the slogan ""Where America Shops"" traces its origins back to 1886 when Richard Sears, a railway worker, began selling watches as a sideline.

He rapidly teamed up with Alvah Roebuck, a watch repairman, with the pair launching a mail-order business selling watches and jewellery the following year.

By the mid-1890s they were selling other items, including cars, sporting goods and sewing machines. Mr Roebuck sold his stake in the business shortly afterwards and a new partner, Julius Rosenwald, came on board.

Until then, Sears had been focused on rural America, but Mr Rosenwald spotted an opportunity in the country's fast-growing cities. He opened the group's first department store, in Chicago, in 1925 and, over time, the stores became more important than the mail order business.

That is not to say the mail order business did not evolve. In 1933, it produced its first Christmas gift catalogue specifically containing toys, called the Sears Wish Book.

Gordon Weil, author of Sears, Roebuck, USA, told the Wall Street Journal this week: ""At a time when the country was going through the Great Depression, struggling to establish a sense of identity, [Sears] created a sense of security and reliability.

""The Sears catalogue was everywhere. In an age before there was the internet, it was in some respects the equivalent of a search engine, that united the country.

""Everyone had access to the same giant catalogue…that had all kinds of things from tools to appliances to homes. It went from there to being the source from which rural America in particular could buy anything it wanted, even though there were no local stores.""

It was a business that inspired trust among its customers. It was one of the first retailers anywhere to introduce the concept of ""satisfaction guaranteed or your money back"" and its slogans, which also included ""Sears Has Everything"", helped create a common sense of purpose among American consumers at a time when US society was a lot more egalitarian.

So what went wrong? While some have blamed Amazon, that is rather too simplistic an explanation, although it may have been true in the last decade or so.

A likelier explanation is that the shared sense of purpose in America which made Sears great was gradually eroded.

Wealth inequalities increased and different sets of consumers emerged. Consumers started to want different things from each other and, by extension, from different retailers.

Better use of data and management information meant retailers could better segment those consumers and target them more specifically.

Diversification into other products and services - insurance in 1931, stockbroking and commercial property in the 1980s - may also have hastened the demise.

A sense grew in the 1970s that Sears had become just too stodgy as a business and took its eye off the ball. Its share of general merchandise sales in the US fell from 5.61% in 1978 to 4.07% in 1987.

According to Mr Weil, Sears was also late to realise the importance of the power of discounting, as practised by rivals like Kmart and Walmart, to become ""just another store"", but that is only part of the story.

It had also fallen behind some of the more up-market department store operators and, as a result, found itself drifting in the no-man's-land between the up-market players and the discounters.

By the end of the 1990s, as internet shopping gradually took hold, it was locked into a spiral of cutting jobs and closing stores in order to maintain profitability.

A merger with the much younger Kmart - which, like Walmart, had opened its first store in 1962 - followed in 2004 and the name Roebuck was finally dropped."

MUMBAI (Reuters) - U.S. online giant Amazon said its festive season sale in India had got off to a strong start, with three times the number of people signing up to shop in the first two days compared to last year.

Amazon and homegrown Indian rival Flipkart, owned by Walmart, kicked off competing sales events on Wednesday, jostling to grab shoppers in India's October-December festive season when households make most big-ticket purchases.

""We are particularly excited by the three times higher new customer and Prime sign ups,"" Amit Agarwal, Amazon's India head said on Friday, adding the site is becoming the destination of choice for existing and new customers across India.

The comment comes after Flipkart chief Kalyan Krishnamurthy, late on Wednesday, told Reuters Amazon was losing relevance in the country.

Amazon and Flipkart are locked in a battle to dominate an Indian e-commerce market tipped, within a decade, to be worth $200 billion annually, according to Morgan Stanley.

Agarwal said the company's push on attractive credit facilities, product insurance and a Hindi-version of its mobile website were among measures paying off this time around.

Amazon's 'Great Indian Festival' sale will go on till Oct. 15, while Flipkart's version 'Big Billion Days' ends a day earlier.

Amazon, which already has over 100 million registered users in India, is making a deeper push in the country's small towns and cities in a bid to attract another 100 million customers by investing in infrastructure and partnering with local players for quicker deliveries.

Its Prime loyalty program, which offers free delivery, early access to deals during sales and free music and video streaming, has helped Amazon win tens of millions of clients, making India its fastest-growing Prime market globally. Flipkart now offers a similar scheme.

Large appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines as well as TVs are selling in huge numbers in this year's sale, Agarwal said, with fashion products becoming the largest selling category.

Neither company gave specific sales numbers, but said their festive sales will break last year's record as competition intensifies after Walmart's acquisition of a controlling stake in Bengaluru-based Flipkart this year.

""Amazon remains the most visited, most transacted, most trusted online marketplace in India,"" Agarwal said. ""We look forward to maintaining this momentum for the rest of the holiday season."""

30,'Amazon has all the power': How Amazon controls legions of delivery drivers without paying their wages and benefits in the US,Yahoo Finance Australia,2018-10-04,0.833486,0.995936,"Amazon puts delivery service partners in charge of drivers' wages, insurance, health benefits, and vehicle maintenance. Amazon, meanwhile, retains power over nearly every other aspect of these drivers' jobs, according to legal filings and interviews with more than 40 delivery workers, including drivers, supervisors, owners of courier companies, and Amazon logistics managers. ""Amazon has long supported small businesses like our Delivery Service Partners, and they are an important part of the long-term success of the company,"" the company said. Amazon can ""turn the knobs"" on delivery service partners because it has total control over the companies' revenue, sources said. Amazon managers, who work on-site at delivery stations with drivers and their supervisors, have discretion over route assignments, sources said.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/apos-amazon-power-apos-amazon-055424315.html,"There are thousands of drivers working full time out of Amazon facilities who deliver Amazon packages, meet daily with Amazon bosses, and, in some cases, wear Amazon uniforms.

Their daily delivery routes and deadlines are set by Amazon. Amazon trains many of the drivers, provides them with on-the-road support, and gives them devices, called ""rabbits,"" for package scanning and route navigation.

Amazon uses the rabbits to track drivers' movements and has the power to eliminate drivers who aren't cutting it, two former Amazon managers told Business Insider.

It also doesn't offer them the protections, benefits, or other perks - like its new, highly touted $US15 minimum wage - afforded to its own employees. That's because none of these drivers actually works for Amazon.

The company instead employs these drivers indirectly through contracts with smaller third-party companies, called delivery service partners, or DSPs. Amazon's DSP network is like its version of UPS and FedEx, carriers Amazon also uses to deliver its packages.

Amazon puts delivery service partners in charge of drivers' wages, insurance, health benefits, and vehicle maintenance.

Amazon, meanwhile, retains power over nearly every other aspect of these drivers' jobs, according to legal filings and interviews with more than 40 delivery workers, including drivers, supervisors, owners of courier companies, and Amazon logistics managers.

For Amazon, this system of contracting delivery jobs is a cost-effective alternative to direct employment.

But it has created a massively confusing chain of command for drivers, which some say has led to chronic problems with missing wages, lack of overtime, intimidation, broken delivery trucks, and gruelling shifts that have lasted as long as 15 hours without time for breaks.

""The DSP contract-labour model is absolutely to mitigate risk and not take on the cost and obligation to actually employ people, so Amazon can move and scale fast,"" said a former Amazon logistics manager, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution. ""The DSPs are under such a financial pinch they are not always taking care of their vans or making sure they are keeping up standards.""

Amazon is at the root of the problem, this person said.

""We create this pressure cooker,"" they said. ""We are really turning the knobs on DSPs, and they are turning the knobs on drivers. And then at the end of the day we can take our hands off of it and say, 'Well, they are your employees.'""

Amazon said that while it doesn't directly control wage-setting and benefits, it regularly audits its delivery service partners and requires them to abide by labour laws.

""Amazon has long supported small businesses like our Delivery Service Partners, and they are an important part of the long-term success of the company,"" the company said. ""We regularly receive feedback from our Delivery Service Partners to ensure we're providing the right tools and processes to help them operate successful businesses.""

In an email seen by Business Insider, Amazon told these courier companies this week that they'd have to start electronically tracking and recording employees' hours using ""time and attendance tracking"" software provided by the payroll company ADP. The requirement, which takes effect November 19, followed an earlier Business Insider investigation that detailed numerous reports of missing wages and lack of overtime payments.

Amazon can ""turn the knobs"" on delivery service partners because it has total control over the companies' revenue, sources said.

Amazon pays courier companies a set amount for each route delivered on any given day. The number of routes assigned to a company can vary weekly.

Amazon managers, who work on-site at delivery stations with drivers and their supervisors, have discretion over route assignments, sources said.

""We were walking on eggshells,"" said an owner of a courier company. ""You don't want to make the guy angry that gives out the routes, because if you make him angry, he isn't going to give you the number of routes you want.""

In some cases, this power dynamic led to free lunches, this person said.

""People were buying lunches for people at Amazon"" to try to get more routes, they said. ""If you are in with Amazon, you can do no wrong. They will give more routes to those people."""

A spokesperson for Microsoft tells Business Insider that the company is investigating the claims. It also points out that generally speaking, only advanced users will have installed the update - Windows 10 PCs won't start prompting people to install the update on their PCs until October 9th, meaning that anybody who already has the update has actively sought it out.

Affected users quickly noticed that files in their user directory - where folders like Documents and Pictures are found - were missing after the update. Even after reverting the update to the previous version of Windows, the files were still gone. One user on the Microsoft support forum said they lost over 200 GB of files after installing the update. Other forum members reported similar issues.

The issue with missing or deleted files could be linked to OneDrive, Microsoft's cloud service, according to mspoweruser.com and Twitter user @coolKevinator.

Additionally, it appeared the update was causing computers' processors to overexert themselves, resulting in a lower battery life for laptops. The excessive processor use appears to result from compatibility issues with the Intel Display Audio drivers running with some Intel processors, and Microsoft is aware of the issue. The company is now blocking downloads of the new update on potentially affected machines until the correct drivers are installed.

A nationwide minimum wage of $US15 an hour would require all of the company's retail competitors to pay their store workers at least that amount. Plus, a new federal minimum wage would force Walmart to direct resources away from developing new innovations to compete against Amazon, Farren argued. A higher minimum wage might not even affect Amazon that much in the long run. The more that they automate their production process, the less that a higher federal minimum wage would hurt Amazon.""",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/economist-explains-amazon-could-lobbying-101742391.html,"In raising its standard wage to $US15 an hour, Amazon has turned an enemy - Sen. Bernie Sanders - into a friend and gained what could be a powerful new weapon.

Amazon's statements about the raises indicate that it wants to position the move as a moral one.

""We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. ""We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.""

The new wage standard will be effective November 1.

At the same time, Amazon is trying to force other retailers to follow by directing the company's lobbying team to start advocating for a federal increase in the minimum wage to the same $US15 an hour it will now pay workers.

""We will be working to gain Congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage. The current rate of $US7.25 was set nearly a decade ago,"" Jay Carney, Amazon's head of global corporate affairs, said in a prepared statement. ""We intend to advocate for a minimum wage increase that will have a profound impact on the lives of tens of millions of people and families across this country.""

Amazon is also positioning this lobbying effort as moral, but that may not be the only reason the e-commerce giant would be incentivized to do it. A nationwide minimum wage of $US15 an hour would require all of the company's retail competitors to pay their store workers at least that amount.

In that way, Amazon could be ""weaponizing"" policy, according to economist Michael Farren of the right-leaning think tank The Mercatus Center, which is generally against government regulation.

""When Amazon tries to force others through lobbying efforts to compete in the way that they have a competitive advantage, that's the point where you have taken ... a policy or a regulation that is theoretically in the public interest and you've weaponised it to turn it into a private interest,"" Farren said to Business Insider.

Workers in stores already tend to make less than workers in distribution warehouses on average. It was theoretically a smaller cost for Amazon to bump its workers up to $US15 than it would be for Walmart to bump all of its store employees up to $US15.

Large store chains like Walmart and Target are already raising wages on their own, but not to the $US15 target that Amazon is proposing. The competition for low-wage workers has become more fierce in recent years as the US labour market has grown more competitive, sparking a ""war for talent.""

Plus, a new federal minimum wage would force Walmart to direct resources away from developing new innovations to compete against Amazon, Farren argued.

In addition, Amazon's technological forays into automation are further along than competitors, he said. A higher minimum wage might not even affect Amazon that much in the long run.

""Amazon's business model is premised on constant innovation,"" Farren said. ""That's one of the reasons why they're so scary to other industries. The more that they automate their production process, the less that a higher federal minimum wage would hurt Amazon."""

Amazon's new concept bakes an advertisement for Prime into every price tag. The value of Prime has risen steadily as Amazon has added more benefits to the program over the years. ""Prime delivers such massive scale and features that we believe it would be very difficult for any company to replicate and compete against, and Amazon continues to expand and add more value to Prime by adding new benefits and growing existing offerings,"" the analysts wrote. Amazon has a vested interest in keeping these Prime customers happy. Prime customers are by far Amazon's most loyal, buying more stuff more often.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-wants-show-person-valuable-060657866.html,"Amazon wants to show you in person how valuable prime is

Amazon's new concept bakes an advertisement for Prime into every price tag.

The store, called Amazon 4-star, stocks only items that customers have rated four stars or above, on average, on Amazon.com. That means it will include only the best of the best, in the eyes of Amazon's customers.

It opened in Manhattan's SoHo neighbourhood on September 27, and another will reportedly open in Berkeley, California, soon.

The store essentially uses the same format as the brand's AmazonBooks store, but has more categories on offer, including toys and games, home and kitchen, and yes, books. Amazon 4-star also displays customer reviews as Amazon Books and the same cashless checkout process.

It also uses the same pricing system, where Prime members pay the Amazon.com price but everyone else pays the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Both prices are displayed on the electronic price tag under every item of merchandise.

The difference is stark when compared to AmazonBooks. While books are something people generally are prepared to the full price on the back cover - the same price they'd pay at Barnes & Noble or a local bookstore - other merchandise is more regularly discounted.

In effect, that means every purchase - or purchase considered - will show customers a little slice of what the membership offers, either consoling them if they're members or one step close to convincing them to join.

Amazon also made joining frictionless, with a 30-day free trial available at check-out.

Amazon knows that Prime is its golden goose. It keeps adding more and more to the suite of benefits it provides its members.

While many still associate Prime solely with its two-day-shipping guarantee, it also has other benefits like video and music streaming, and there are some items that are available only to Prime members, which creates additional value.

In May, Prime members were given another perk: big discounts at Whole Foods, the roll out of which was completed this summer.

The value of Prime has risen steadily as Amazon has added more benefits to the program over the years. A recent JP Morgan analysis estimated that the service is actually worth $US785 a year when everything it offers is counted together. That's six and a half times the actual cost of an annual Prime subscription of $US120 a year, even with this year's price increase.

""Prime delivers such massive scale and features that we believe it would be very difficult for any company to replicate and compete against, and Amazon continues to expand and add more value to Prime by adding new benefits and growing existing offerings,"" the analysts wrote.

That means that even if a customer does not take advantage of everything Prime membership has to offer, there's still the perception that they're getting a good value for their money.

Amazon has a vested interest in keeping these Prime customers happy. Prime customers are by far Amazon's most loyal, buying more stuff more often. They're also more likely to delve deeper in the Amazon ecosystem, taking up Alexa-enabled devices and subscribing to addition services like Amazon Music."

The Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources, that Microsoft's investment totaled around $US200 million, although a Grab spokesperson refuted the accuracy of that amount, without clarifying to Business Insider if that amount was too high or too low.

On Friday, Reuters reported that Japan's SoftBank was set to invest around $US500 million in Grab in the coming weeks.

Large open fields stretch in one direction, and suburban houses are in the other. In the distance, you can catch a glimpse of Mount Rainier.

The setting is almost picturesque - until you remember that before you is an Amazon fulfillment center that spans nearly 1 million square feet. Inside, Amazon workers spend 10 hours a day, four days a week, ensuring your order gets to you on time.

It's the core of Amazon's business, and also one of the most controversial. Current and former employees have told horror stories of a workplace that's so fast-paced and strenuous that workers don't even have time to use the bathroom.

The smart speaker will be sold for $US149 and is available for preorder on Google's site. The Home Hub will be available in four colours, and will be available in retail stores in the US, UK, and Australia starting on October 22nd.

Notably, the Home Hub does not have a camera. This means you can't make or take video calls, unlike home assistants with visuals from Amazon and Facebook.

The smart speaker will act as the hub of your ""thoughtful home,"" with a new app that connects all of your smart home devices, Google's Diya Jolly said at the event Tuesday. Called Home View, the app can control smart devices from thousands of companies and brands, including locks, security cameras, room temperatures, and lights.

The device also comes with Ambient EQ technology, which changes the Home Hub's display based on the time of day and lighting in the room. Additionally, the speaker uses Google's existing ""voice match"" technology, which lets Google Assistant recognise each household member and personalise its answers.

""Because Hub recognised my voice, it was able to tell me everything happening in my day while I'm finishing up my coffee,"" said Mark Spates, Google's product lead for smart speakers.

The smart device can use Google Photos to create ""live albums"" that you can specify to include specific people, and technology that will display only your best photos while removing ones that are blurry, duplicates, or poor quality.

The Home Hub will come with a free six-month subscription to YouTube Premium, which lets viewers watch videos ad-free and access the YouTube Music streaming service.

This is Google's latest product in its line of Home smart speakers, which kicked off with the eponymous speaker two years ago. All come built-in with the Google Assistant, which can provide users with information on weather, news, your personal commute and schedule, and other important data.

The Home Hub looks like Google's response to the Amazon Echo Show, which was first released in June 2017, and updated only a few weeks ago. However, users are unable to access YouTube on Amazon's device, after Google pulled the app from the Echo Show last year. The updated version of Amazon Echo Show costs $US230.

It will also go up against Facebook's newly-announced Portal video-chatting device, which starts at $US200. Again, though, the Home Hub doesn't have a camera, a decision that Google made ""consciously,"" said Jolly, VP of product management.

Another Google-powered smart visual speaker does already exist on the market. Lenovo released its Smart Display earlier this year with built-in Google Assistant for $US200. However, the Google Home Hub is the first made by Google itself."

Read more: How to Keep a Billion-Dollar Fortune in the Family, Korea Style

Special prosecutors discovered in 2008 that Lee had stashed away assets worth 4.5 trillion won in accounts under the names of 486 people, made up of former and then-current Samsung employees. Lee, who admitted this was part of his inheritance, stepped down from the helm of Samsung in 2008 with a promise to convert those accounts into his own name and to find ways to spend the money that came to light for social benefits after settling his unpaid taxes. ""The major reason for using accounts not in your own name is to avoid tax, especially inheritance tax,"" said Kim Nam-geun, vice chairman of a Seoul-based liberal legal association called Lawyers for a Democratic Society.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-family-apos-4-billion-035302810.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Ordinary families might stash spare cash under a mattress or in a safety deposit box. South Korea’s Lee family are so rich they spent years leaving billions of dollars under the names of their employees.

This strategy is back in the spotlight after first being exposed in an investigation by prosecutors that led to the 2009 conviction of Samsung Electronics Co. Chairman Lee Kun-hee. He was found guilty of evading taxes through borrowed names and handed a suspended prison sentence. He was pardoned at the end of 2009 to help the country win its bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics.

A South Korean civic group filed a case against Lee last month, claiming he illegitimately acquired the wealth from his late father, Samsung founder Lee Byung-chull. They accused Lee of failing to pay taxes for the inheritance that was passed down through accounts using other people’s names.

The accusation comes several months after police said they uncovered 260 fresh accounts under the names of 72 different Samsung executives harboring about 400 billion won ($352 million) worth of assets belonging to Lee. Police released the details in a statement this February, while a police officer who investigated the case separately confirmed the size of the assets.

The accounts were managed by what used to be the conglomerate’s core governing body, whose latest name was Future Strategy Office. The office, dubbed as the control tower of Samsung, was disbanded last year amid mounting public criticism over its involvement in a graft scandal that resulted in the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye and the conviction of Lee’s son, Jay Y. Lee, for bribery. Samsung Electronics Co. Vice Chairman Lee was released from prison in February after his sentence was suspended.

The employees, whose identities weren’t disclosed, told police they handed copies of their IDs over when the company requested, according to local media reports.

It’s unlikely they ever got their hands on the money, or even had knowledge of the accounts. The strategy office was involved in the whole process from opening to making withdrawals, an official at the Financial Supervisory Service told a parliamentary audit in October last year.

""Accounts found to belong to Lee no longer contain money in most cases,"" Park Yong-jin, a ruling party lawmaker said in a phone interview. ""He took out the money without complying with any legal procedures, including converting the accounts into his own name.""

The findings highlight how far some wealthy individuals may go to conceal their wealth. In the past five years, data leaks like the Panama Papers – comprising more than 11 million files from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca & Co. – have exposed the complex network of cross-border structures that rich people sometimes use to stash their assets in tax havens.

They also come at a time when governments are cracking down. Last month, more than 100 nations received unprecedented levels of financial data on their overseas residents through an OECD-led initiative to target individuals evading taxes.

Set at 50 percent, South Korea’s top inheritance tax rate is one of the highest among developed nations, driving wealthy families to resort to circuitous -- if largely legal -- measures to preserve and pass down their wealth without paying hefty tax bills.

Special prosecutors discovered in 2008 that Lee had stashed away assets worth 4.5 trillion won in accounts under the names of 486 people, made up of former and then-current Samsung employees. The 1,229 accounts bore some 2.2 trillion won at the end of 2007, according to the FSS report submitted to lawmaker Park earlier this year.

Lee, who admitted this was part of his inheritance, stepped down from the helm of Samsung in 2008 with a promise to convert those accounts into his own name and to find ways to spend the money that came to light for social benefits after settling his unpaid taxes.

""The major reason for using accounts not in your own name is to avoid tax, especially inheritance tax,"" said Kim Nam-geun, vice chairman of a Seoul-based liberal legal association called Lawyers for a Democratic Society. ""When the Samsung founder passed away, he left behind massive fortunes, along with huge tax burdens for his children.""

All of the false-name accounts belonging to Lee don’t appear to have undergone a change of holders, according to the report. And the newly discovered accounts had been maintained under names of the Samsung executives until 2011, according to police, who declined to comment on when they were opened. Lee made the late payment of 130 billion won in tax in 2011 when the accounts were reported to the National Tax Service, but the investigation accused him of evading taxes of another 8.2 billion won on the profits from those accounts. Police couldn’t question Lee directly due to his health issues and sent the case to prosecutors. Lee remains hospitalized after suffering a heart attack in 2014. Prosecutors confirmed they are currently investigating, without commenting on when the findings will come out. Samsung Electronics has no access to details related to the chairman’s personal finance, a company spokeswoman said. ""It is our understanding that taxes levied by the authorities on the accounts in question have been paid in full."" Lee has said that the accounts, which mostly held stocks in Samsung companies, were part of his inheritance and they were to help him maintain control over the conglomerate. Lee is currently the richest person in South Korea with a net worth of $17.4 billion. His son, Samsung Electronics Co. Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee, is the country’s third-richest with $6.9 billion. Tax authorities disclosed in August that they had collected more than 109 billion won in taxes from actual owners behind accounts in other people’s names in the first half of this year. The National Tax Service, citing the confidentiality of taxpayer information, declined to answer how much of it was generated from Lee. For lawyer Kim, it’s too little and too late. ""The government should have taken action at the time of the 2008 investigation in order to collect most of what Lee had owed,"" he said. --With assistance from Ben Stupples and Tom Metcalf.

AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have all tried to woo organizations and companies by touting the capabilities and performance of their services, which help organizations store and process data remotely, build new applications and adopt new  intelligence. “SAP announced its multi-cloud strategy more than two years ago,” a spokesman for the Walldorf, Germany-based software company said in a statement, referring to SAP’s plan to maintain a presence on the world’s largest public clouds, such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, International Business Machines Corp. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud. While SAP has spent more money with Microsoft and Google over the past 12 months, “our SAP internal share of wallet stays pretty stable at 70 percent,” according to the text of the AWS memo. The Symantec deal represented an increase of more than seven times in the cybersecurity company's spending on AWS, meaning that it “has been able to capture more than 80 percent” of Symantec's cloud spending, according to the document.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-lands-1-billion-cloud-211416942.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division of Amazon.com Inc., signed new deals with customers SAP SE and Symantec Corp. worth a combined $1 billion, according to an internal memo, underscoring the company’s growing momentum in the market for internet-based computing power and storage.

The contracts are each worth $500 million over 5 years, the text of an Amazon email from September showed. Both transactions represented expansions of existing partnerships. Microsoft Corp., the No. 2 cloud-services provider, had also competed for the Symantec deal, according to the memo.

Some of the world's largest technology companies have been duking it out for supremacy in the cloud. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have all tried to woo organizations and companies by touting the capabilities and performance of their services, which help organizations store and process data remotely, build new applications and adopt new  intelligence. AWS has so far maintained the lead, winning $17.5 billion in sales last year. That's out of a market estimated to have been worth $30 billion in 2017, and expected to balloon to $83.5 billion by 2021, according to research firm Gartner Inc.

“SAP announced its multi-cloud strategy more than two years ago,” a spokesman for the Walldorf, Germany-based software company said in a statement, referring to SAP’s plan to maintain a presence on the world’s largest public clouds, such as AWS, Microsoft, Google, International Business Machines Corp. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud. “We believe in the power of collaboration.” SAP declined to comment on the Amazon agreement outlined in the memo.

“We do not disclose details of the agreements underlying our relationships,” Symantec Chief Information Officer Sheila Jordan said in a statement. “As our cloud business has evolved, we have continuously evaluated our business relationships with our cloud partners.” Symantec is committed to a multi-partner cloud strategy and works with partners including AWS, Azure, Oracle and other global and regional suppliers, she added.

The annual haul from the two deals – $200 million per year – is a little less than 1 percent of annualized revenue for AWS. The unit notched sales of $11.5 billion for the six months that ended June 30, according to a regulatory filing. Amazon shares were little changed in early trading Wednesday and are up 60 percent this year. SAP slipped 2.1 percent bringing gains this year to 8.9 percent. Symantec, which is down 29 percent this year, was also little changed.

AWS has been focusing on maintaining its sales leadership in the face of growing traction from its rivals. While SAP has spent more money with Microsoft and Google over the past 12 months, “our SAP internal share of wallet stays pretty stable at 70 percent,” according to the text of the AWS memo. The new deal is for the base layer of computing and storage services, as well as other tools for data management, AI and the internet of things.

The Symantec deal represented an increase of more than seven times in the cybersecurity company's spending on AWS, meaning that it “has been able to capture more than 80 percent” of Symantec's cloud spending, according to the document. Symantec will migrate its Managed Security Service, Network Protection and Website Security Service products to AWS in the next 18 to 24 months, the memo showed.

45,IBM Protests Pentagon Cloud Contract Expected to Favor Amazon,Yahoo Finance Australia,2018-10-10,0.880058,0.754722,"(Bloomberg) -- International Business Machines Corp. said it has filed a protest against the Pentagon’s planned winner-take-all cloud computing contract because it restricts the field of competition. “Throughout the year-long JEDI saga, countless concerns have been raised that this solicitation is aimed at a specific vendor,” Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal wrote on a company blog on Wednesday.

“Throughout the year-long JEDI saga, countless concerns have been raised that this solicitation is aimed at a specific vendor,” Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal wrote on a company blog on Wednesday. “At no point have steps been taken to alleviate those concerns.”

IBM follows Oracle Corp. as the second technology company to challenge the Pentagon’s Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract valued at as much as $10 billion, which is widely seen as favoring Amazon.com Inc., the dominant cloud-services provider. The move increases pressure on the Defense Department to defend its requirements for the contract.

The Jedi project involves moving massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Companies are due to submit proposals on Friday.

Companies including IBM, Oracle and Microsoft Corp. have opposed a winner-take-all award, arguing it will stifle innovation and raise security risks for the Pentagon.

“We firmly believe in our heart of our hearts, in our technical background, that the single-cloud approach is the wrong approach,” IBM’s Gordy said in an interview. “We believe America’s warfighters deserve the best, not just good.""

He described IBM’s protest as a “last-ditch effort for sanity to prevail” in the JEDI procurement process.

At least nine companies have at some point coordinated their opposition in Washington to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, Bloomberg News has reported.

A spokeswoman for the Pentagon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Defense Department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that “could prevent DoD from rapidly delivering new capabilities and improved effectiveness to the warfighter that enterprise-level cloud computing can enable.”

Gordy went beyond the debate over a single-source contract, arguing that the requirements the Pentagon outlined either mirror a certain vendor’s internal processes -- he didn’t mention Amazon by name -- or unnecessarily mandate that certain capabilities be in place by the bid submission date instead of when the work would begin.

“Such rigid requirements serve only one purpose: to arbitrarily narrow the field of bidders,” he said in his blog post.

The Government Accountability Office can confirm or deny contractor protests and make recommendations to a federal agency overseeing a contract.

While the GAO sustained only 2.6 percent of defense protests filed since 2008, the Rand Corp.’s National Defense Research Institute reported in January, “the majority of relief to protesters takes the form of corrective actions” by the contracting agency while a challenge is pending before the GAO or withdrawn based on the potential for solving issues short of a decision.

46,Amazon built an AI tool to hire people but had to shut it down because it was discriminating against women,Yahoo Finance Australia,2018-10-10,0.723233,0.745818,"Amazon worked on building an artificial-intelligence tool to help with hiring, but the plans backfired when the company discovered the system discriminated against women, Reuters reports.

Citing five sources, Reuters said Amazon set up an engineering team in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2014 to find a way to automate its recruitment.

The company created 500 computer models to trawl through past candidates' résumés and pick up on about 50,000 key terms. The system would crawl the web to recommend candidates.

""They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 résumés, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those,"" one source told Reuters.

A year later, however, the engineers reportedly noticed something troubling about their engine - it didn't like women. This was apparently because the AI combed through predominantly male résumés submitted to Amazon over a 10-year period to accrue data about whom to hire.

Consequently, the AI concluded that men were preferable. It reportedly downgraded résumés containing the words ""women's"" and filtered out candidates who had attended two women-only colleges.

Amazon's engineers apparently tweaked the system to remedy these particular forms of bias but couldn't be sure the AI wouldn't find new ways to unfairly discriminate against candidates.

Gender bias was not the only problem, Reuters' sources said. The computer programs also spat out candidates who were unqualified for the position.

Remedying algorithmic bias is a thorny issue, as algorithms can pick up on subconscious human bias. In 2016, ProPublica found that risk-assessment software used to forecast which criminals were most likely to reoffend exhibited racial bias against black people. Overreliance on AI for things like recruitment, credit-scoring, and parole judgments have also created issues in the past.

Amazon reportedly abandoned the AI recruitment project by the beginning of last year after executives lost faith in it. Reuters' sources said Amazon recruiters looked at recommendations generated by the AI but never relied solely on its judgment.

Amazon told Business Insider it was committed to workplace diversity and equality but declined to comment further."
47,Microsoft CEO Backs Federal Privacy Law Over State Efforts,Yahoo Finance Australia,2018-10-11,0.834025,0.558353,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella joined a swelling chorus calling for national privacy legislation, days after Google became the latest tech giant to reveal a personal data breach. “We hope that there’s more of a national privacy law,” Nadella said in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg News at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he discussed leadership with midshipmen. Tech companies are already facing tough new European privacy rules that went into effect in May, while California passed a strict data privacy law in June. A national law is preferable to legislation forged by individual states and would reduce “transactional costs” to the benefit of companies large and small, Nadella said. AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., the nation’s biggest telephone companies, have publicly urged lawmakers to draw up one set of national consumer privacy rules.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-backs-federal-privacy-214135805.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella joined a swelling chorus calling for national privacy legislation, days after Google became the latest tech giant to reveal a personal data breach.

“We hope that there’s more of a national privacy law,” Nadella said in an interview Wednesday with Bloomberg News at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he discussed leadership with midshipmen.

Tech companies are already facing tough new European privacy rules that went into effect in May, while California passed a strict data privacy law in June. A national law is preferable to legislation forged by individual states and would reduce “transactional costs” to the benefit of companies large and small, Nadella said.

His comments reflect growing ferment around privacy following failures by tech companies. Senator John Thune, a South Dakota Republican and the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said at a hearing earlier Wednesday that Congress is contemplating privacy legislation.

“It is increasingly clear that industry self-regulation in this area is not sufficient,” Thune said in prepared remarks.

Alphabet Inc.’s Google became the latest example of flawed privacy protections earlier this week. The company said it found a “software glitch” in its Google+ social network in March that could have exposed the personal data of as many as half a million users, but decided not to tell the public about it until Monday.

At a September Senate hearing, executives of big tech companies told Congress that they favor new federal consumer safeguards. Apple Inc. suggested its own privacy concepts be incorporated into legislation.

AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., the nation’s biggest telephone companies, have publicly urged lawmakers to draw up one set of national consumer privacy rules. The carriers, which have operations in every state, fear that a lack of comprehensive legislation will create inconsistent rules across the country.

Nadella in the interview also addressed cybersecurity issues, and said Microsoft wasn’t affected by a hack that Bloomberg Businessweek reported involved tampering in China of critical technology components bound for the U.S.

“We’re very confident that we have no exposure,” Nadella said.

Under Nadella, Microsoft is confronting issues such as whether restraints are needed on emerging artificial intelligence products, and how to stop computer-enabled election interference. At the same time, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant is trying to land a major defense contract.

Microsoft on Tuesday said it’s on track to catch up with Amazon.com Inc. by obtaining top federal security authorizations early next year. That could bolster the company’s position in a winner-take-all competition for a multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract from the Pentagon. Amazon Web Services already holds the required security certification.

Tech companies are preparing to submit bids, due Friday, for the contract that could last as long as 10 years and be valued at as much as $10 billion.

49,Senator Says Google Failed to Answer Key Questions on China,Yahoo Finance Australia,2018-10-12,0.688974,0.626873,"(Bloomberg) -- Google refused to answer specific questions from U.S. senators about plans for China, saying it’s too early to know exactly what the company’s path forward in the country will be.

Google has always been interested in expanding its presence in China but it’s ""unclear"" if the company will restart a search engine there, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said in an Aug. 31 letter to six senators, including Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, whose office provided Bloomberg News with the letter.

Google has been working on a search engine that would be censored to comply with Chinese laws. When news of the plan emerged in August, it prompted criticism from inside and outside the company. Warner has led the charge in Congress, demanding the Alphabet Inc. unit spell out how it will work with China. Google employees have resigned over the issue, and others have said the move would contradict the company’s founding principal of “don’t be evil.” Pichai is set to speak in front of Congress before the end of the year.

“Their response to the Senate failed to provide any information about Google’s reported plans to consider launching a censored search engine in China,” Warner said in an emailed statement. “Any effort to get back into China could enable the Chinese government in repressing and manipulating their citizens.”

Pichai’s letter underlines how seriously Google takes China. The company’s Android operating system is the dominant one for Chinese phone users, and Google has hundreds of employees working in the country, Pichai wrote. He hinted that Google’s global competitiveness may hinge on its ability to go toe-to-toe with China’s domestic internet giants.

“China’s largest internet companies have become increasingly dynamic and innovative,” Pichai said. “We hope to stay at the forefront of technology developments and believe that Google’s tools could help to facilitate an exchange of information and learning that would have broad benefits inside and outside of China.” The Intercept reported on Pichai’s letter earlier Friday.

The Mountain View company has already confirmed the return of the squeezable Active Edge feature in the forthcoming phones, and now it has started to tease fans with the possibility of a new screen size, too.

Google has shared a new post on its official Instagram page with the caption: ""We’ve heard rumors of a mini Pixel. Which begs the question how 'mini' is too mini?

""We have a feeling the next one will be a bit bigger than this. Tune in on 10/9 to see for yourself.""

The photograph accompanying the cryptic post shows four smartphones of various sizes lying face down next to one another on a wooden desk.

The smallest handset, which appears to be around the same size as a house key, has a small yellow sticky note labelled ""this one?"" beside it.

Google's post is an explicit reference to the recent flurry of rumours that suggest the leaked Pixel 3 XL prototypes that surfaced online this summer were deliberately created to throw people off the scent.

Not only that, but the theory claims Google is actually developing an all-new flagship handset, dubbed Pixel Ultra, that will not resemble any of the leaked devices.

That theory is based on the fact that a number of high-profile YouTubers have been contacted directly by Google to ask for permission to use their Pixel 3 XL videos, many of which contain complaints about the prominent notch on the leaked phone.

This prompted speculation that a notch-less Pixel 3 XL variant that was carefully hidden from leaks would be unveiled during the October 9 press conference.

It seems unlikely that Google – which has suffered a number of leaks around unannounced Pixel and Nexus hardware – would be able to pull-off such a stunt.

Even Google seems to be mocking the idea that a never-before-seen Pixel Ultra exists with its “mini Pixel” teaser image on Instagram.

That said, it's worth noting the smartphones included in the teaser image all appear to have two rear-facing cameras – something not included in the recent Pixel 3 leaks.

We’ll know more about the Google Pixel 3 range on October 9, 2018."

Amazon has developed a massive marketing campaign around its Fire Stick range and it was a big hit thanks to streaming app Kodi, which gave access to sport, films and other streams.

Amazon has now added voice control to the Fire Stick in the form of Alexa, as well as the ability to watch TV in 4K for those with a television able to handle it.

It even has volume controls for the first time, meaning you do not have to reach for the remote if you want to change the volume of your television.

The Fire Stick is a small USB-style device that plugs into your television. Once connected to the internet wirelessly it allows you to download popular streaming apps such as Netflix, BBC iPlayer, 4oD and others.

Of course, Amazon wants you to use the device primarily for Amazon Prime Video, which has films, TV series and popular documentaries such as the recent Manchester City documentary, All or Nothing.

The device keeps the apps all in one place and allows you to download and stream films and series onto your TV.

The new Fire Stick is now compatible with 4K streaming on TVs that offer 4K and it all comes with a remote that uses Alexa for voice control.

The older Fire TV Stock costs £40 and the new 4K version is £49.99 on Amazon .

However, it will only be released on 14 November so you may have to wait to get your hands on it.

As a new product it is unlikely to be drastically discounted for Amazon's Black Friday but keep an eye out for flash sales around 23 November and you might be able to shave some pennies off the price.

When is Black Friday 2018? Everything you need to know about the big sale

The Amazon Fire Stick 4K does run one of the most popular apps around - Kodi.

Kodi shot to fame a couple of years ago as a free app that allows users to watch thousands of channels. Over 5 million homes in the UK use the app to watch sport, films and other TV channels.

Using Kodi is not illegal, but selling devices with it pre-installed is. This is because Kodi is often used to stream paid-for sports channels, movies and other TV shows free.

Government agencies and ISPs are cracking down on Kodi use and many of the more popular depositories for streams are being shut down.

While Kodi is available on the Fire Stick 4K, it will not have the same amount of channels as it previously did because of this crackdown."

Google revealed WebP eight years ago and since then has built it into its Chrome web browser, Android phone software and many of its online properties in an effort to put websites on a diet and cut network data usage. But Google had trouble encouraging rival browser makers to embrace it.

Mozilla initially rejected WebP as not offering enough of an improvement over more widely used image formats, JPEG and PNG. It seriously evaluated WebP but chose to try to squeeze more out of JPEG. But now Mozilla -- like Microsoft with its Edge browser earlier this week -- has had a change of heart.

""Mozilla is moving forward with implementing support for WebP,"" the nonprofit organization said. WebP will work in versions of Firefox based on its Gecko browser engine, Firefox for personal computers and Android but not for iOS. Mozilla plans to add support in the first half of 2019.

Committing to a new image format on the web is a big deal. In addition to technical challenges and new security risks, embracing a new image format means embracing it for years and years, because removing support at some point in the future will break websites that rely on it.

It's one of the central conundrums of the web. Browser makers and website developers want to advance the technology, but they can't remove older aspects of the foundation as readily as Google can with Android or Apple with its rival iOS software. Websites have a long shelf life.

There are exceptions. Browser makers remove some undesirable interfaces, usually after careful measurement of usage and careful assessment. But it's harder for widely used technology like Adobe Systems' Flash Player. We're several years into a very slow burial of that software foundation. Browser makers and eventually Adobe, too, concluded Flash's security and stability problems deemed it no longer were worthwhile. Ditching it was made possible by years of work building Flash's abilities into the web itself.

Why the change of heart?

""We are seeing a number of developments coming together that might lead to an accelerated adoption of WebP,"" including Edge support, Mozilla said.

Mozilla is a major backer of another image format under development, AVIF. Where WebP is based on Google's VP8 video compression technology, AVIF is based on a newer video format called AV1 from a much broader group, the Alliance for Open Media. That alliance includes a lot of heavy hitters, including Google, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook, but most of its work is focused on the AV1 video format.

""We also look forward to AVIF being ready, and we will continue to invest in it,"" Mozilla said.

Apple briefly dabbled with WebP support in test versions of its Safari browser but removed that support, an inconvenience for any developers who want to use the format but also have to ensure their websites work on iPhones and iPads. Apple declined to comment."

Now, the e-commerce giant has notified affected customers that an employee shared their email addresses with a third-party seller. Amazon told The Wall Street Journal that it already fired that particular employee and booted the seller who received the email addresses off the platform. More importantly, it said no other customer information other than those addresses were disclosed.

Amazon didn't clarify whether that former employee was the sole culprit or if they just happened to be the only one caught out of many. It also didn't specify where they're from and didn't reveal the real scope of the issue. Based on WSJ's previous report, though, sellers have paid Amazon personnel as much as $2,000 for customers' email addresses. By knowing customers' personal accounts, the sellers can directly (and maybe even repeatedly) ask them to change or pull negative reviews, since ""Verified Purchase"" reviews affect products' placement on search results pages. In some instances, they reportedly bribed the employees to pull negative reviews. Seeing as several third-party sellers can list the exact same items, placement is crucial in making a sale.

The company is now asking customers to give it a heads-up if they receive unsolicited emails from sellers, who could offer them free or discounted goods if they go back and change their reviews or give the listing a higher rating. By urging customers to do so, those sellers are also contributing to Amazon's fake review problem, which it has been grappling with for years."

Google's yearly hardware event has become a showcase for a lot of new products, from Pixel 3 phones to Chromecasts to the new Pixel Slate. October is almost here, and this is what we expect to see. CNET will be there, and this is what we think will show up -- including the most-leaked new phone ever.

(The 2012 event scheduled for New York was as Superstorm Sandy loomed offshore.) CNET will be there in force. The event will be streamed live, and you can watch it here.

Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL: Already leaked far and wide

The next-generation Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL phones are going to be the stars of the show, and we seem to already know what the Pixel 3 will look like and what colors it in. H**k, there's even a Pixel 3 XL unboxing and video.

Unless we're all being thrown for a loop, is there anything about the Pixel 3 we don't know?

The Pixel 3 XL has a notch in its display just like the iPhone X and most other 2018 phones. But it also has a ""chin,"" or an extra bit of space between and the edge of the phone. The smaller Pixel 3 is but has top and bottom bezels.

The big question is likely to be ""How good is the camera?"" Both the Pixel 3 and the XL are sticking with a single rear camera (again, according to the leaks). But given the fact that the year-old Pixel 2 camera is still a contender, it'll be interesting to see how the new model compares to the Smart HDR effects available in the new iPhone XS.

There won't be any new Google-made smartwatch, sorry. Maybe next year. In the meantime, new Wear OS watches are appearing with added heart-rate fitness, water resistance NFC Google Pay, and new Qualcomm chips promise a next wave of watches with stepped-up battery life over the next six if you're patient. Or, just download the new version of Wear OS, which improves the whole interface and adds improved Google Fit readouts for fitness goals.

October is already looking like a white-hot month for new computers and tablets: Microsoft's event was Oct. 2 and Apple may still have Mac and iPad Pro announcements to share, too. Google's follow-up to last year's Pixelbook Chromebook is rumored to be a Chrome OS tablet, called Pixel Slate, that can double as a laptop. This could kick off a whole range of Chrome tablets and keyboard accessories.

Google's last significant hardware update to its Chromecast media streamer was the Ultra in 2016. That being said, Google always has Chromecast software updates: the most recent adds Google Assistant to Chromecast, making its TV functions even smarter. A new Chromecast model that adds Bluetooth and improved 5 GHz Wi-Fi leaked through FCC filings back in August -- and now, Best Buy is apparently already selling it (!). But temper your expectations: According to the box already sold at Best Buy, 4K and Amazon Prime support aren't onboard this new model. It looks as if Google may bundle the new Chromecast with a Home Mini speaker as a ""Smart TV Kit,"" too.

Last year, Google went bigger and smaller with its smart speakers, adding the Google Home Mini and Google Home Max. This year, it's all about smart displays: A wave of Google-powered smart display-toting speakers like the Lenovo Smart Display 10 already available from third parties, but rumored Google Home Hub -- which leaked earlier via an FCC filing, too -- will be Google's own  answer to the Amazon Echo Show. It's just in time, too: Amazon unveiled its second-generation Echo Show in September, and it goes on sale just two days after Google's event.

Other stuff we could see on Oct. 9

Based on the long string of leaks, the phones, Chromecast, tablet Home Hub are all very safe bets for official unveilings on Oct. 9. But here are some long shots we might see as well:

Pixel Buds 2: The oddball Google Translate-enabled Pixel Buds that emerged last year were interesting, but maybe their design has just been absorbed into the Pixel 3's included headphones. This year, instead of a connecting band, it would be nice if they were truly independently wireless like AirPods.

More cloud gaming news: Google just announced that it's streaming the latest Assassin's Creed game straight to your Chrome browser. Is this the opening salvo of the rumored ""Yeti"" gaming service -- something built into that new Chromecast? If so, Oct. 9 would be a good time to talk about it.

-- something as weird as Google Clips was last year: Google's weird always-on AI-powered camera, Google Clips, was last year's novelty gadget (actually, it really only arrived last February). Just a friendly reminder that Google, always unpredictable, could very well reveal another oddball AI-powered gadget this year. Maybe Google makes a variant on its 3D VR180 cameras released earlier this year. Or, not.

Don't expect new VR stuff: Google's simple snap-on VR accessories for Daydream-compatible Android phones already work fine and could just hold the course through 2018. If there is an update here, maybe the fit will be readjusted again. Google already has one standalone VR headset, the Lenovo Mirage Solo, that debuted in May. Google's experimenting with new VR features on that headset that could end up being a hint at what will come in 2019, possibly to compete with Facebook's upcoming standalone Oculus Quest, which already looks to offer more features than the Mirage Solo at the same $399 price."

In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Lewis said Chancellor Philip Hammond should impose a 2 per cent charge – dubbed an ‘Amazon tax’ – on goods sold online.

The Tesco boss – whose bold approach at the supermarket giant has earned him the moniker Drastic Dave – said it was time to ‘shift the burden of raising the country’s income’ away from store chains.

Lewis said traditional retailers are caught in a stranglehold of rising costs, taxes, higher wages and competition from aggressive online firms.

He said the money raised should be used to provide a tax break for retailers, which employ 4.2 million people. 



His intervention – a highly unusual and frank analysis by a corporate chief – will be regarded as the most dramatic call for Government action yet from an industry besieged in a rapidly changing world.

It is a significant boost for The Mail on Sunday’s Fair Play On Tax campaign, which was launched last week.

Lewis declined to say whether any communication with Government has taken place. But it is understood that Whitehall officials are aware of his analysis.

His call follows a vow from the Chancellor last week that Britain might ‘go it alone’ with a plan to tax digital firms if it could not reach a consensus with other countries to do so.

Lewis said such a digital services tax was ‘completely separate’ from his proposal.

Industry chiefs say the retail sector has had a torrid year – described by many as ‘the worst in living memory’ – with 40,000 jobs lost.

Retail chains including House of Fraser, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have collapsed while many others have closed swathes of stores.

At Tesco’s office in Clerkenwell, Central London, Lewis said the failure to tax digital firms comprehensively had now become an ‘industry’ issue.

‘Three years ago I talked about a potential lethal cocktail of pressures in the retail industry and now you are seeing that come to fruition,’ he said.

‘The tax burden has reached the point where companies are going bust. Has the Government thought through what happens when retail starts to decline and if the job losses start to become significant?’

Lewis conceded Tesco, despite delivering more than 40 per cent of Britain’s online food orders, would ‘without doubt’ benefit overall.

But he said all his supermarket rivals ‘would get a much better deal out of this than I would’.

Online sales make up about 17 per cent of Britain’s £370 billion a year retail industry and the share is growing rapidly.

Retailers have long complained that they pay a quarter of Britain’s £30 billion business rates bill despite representing just 5 per cent of the economy.

This is because they have a large physical presence. They also have to stump up their share of the £56 billion corporation tax take each year.

By contrast, rapidly growing online firms – many of which utilise business models that wipe out profit or use offshore havens to slash their tax bills – contribute little of either.

One retail executive last night described Lewis’s plan as ‘an Amazon tax’ in reference to longstanding accusations that the company pays far less proportionately than many of its store-based competitors.

Amazon has been accused of paying as little as 2.3 per cent on its UK profits. The UK corporation tax rate on profits is set at 19 per cent.

Lewis said his plan could be used to cut business rates across the sector by 20 per cent.

He added: ‘If I were the Chancellor I’d be saying how do I keep this industry going so I could keep this [tax] take for longer, because if I’m not careful I’m going to kill it.

‘Retail is truly national. If you look at gross Value Added Tax, direct tax, indirect taxes, employment, the number of suppliers to our stores and our business, the contribution in terms of the wider community – the role of retail in the economy is significant and it will be affected by this.’

The Treasury said it has set up an expert panel to assess the issues and it already has a £10 billion long-term help package in place."

But this is a rule of thumb that may not apply when it comes to buying a smartphone.

At the high end of the smartphone market, the latest iPhone X handset costs just shy of £1,000. And while it's an impressive piece of kit, it's quite clearly not within everybody's budget.

The capacity a smartphone has in this day and age is incredible - and it's safe to say that the vast majority of users unlock only a small fraction of their overall potential.

Save for branding and arguably status, for the average man of woman on the street then, there really isn't much to discern one brand or one model from the next.

Of course, what people look for in a smartphone comes down to personal preference.

Is it design? Is it ease of use? Durability?

For the most part, people who are looking to either upgrade or sign up to a new contract tend to look for the best deal .

According the Huawei website, Samsung spend £4bn annually on advertising, while Apple spend around $400m.

Huawei spent $11m in this last year. Why? Because in their words:

""Huawei prefers to spend money on innovation and development of new technologies rather than advertisement.""

A good price is all well and good, but as mentioned at the top of the article, price very often dictates quality in the world of technology.

According to these comparisons with it's current market rivals , however, there are many advantages to owning a Huawei over an iPhone X or a Samsung Galaxy S9.

The latest Huawei model that has been released to compete with both the iPhone X and the Samsung Galaxy S9 is the Huawei P20 Pro - and there are a number of deals for this latest piece of kit from the usual suspects.

Carphone Warehouse users have, to date, given the P20 Pro 4.9/5 for camera quality, 4.9/5 for ease of use, 5/5 for features and 4.8/5 for screen quality.

Their contracts start from £32 per month, while the Lite version starts at less than half of that.

All Carphone Warehouse Huawei deals can be found here .

According to www.mobiles.co.uk , the top selling monthly deal on the Huawei P20 Pro is with Vodafone.

They are offering monthly deals between £23-32 a month with upfront costs between £75-135. Each of those deals, as well as other from O2, can be found through this link .

As we head into the final few months of 2018, however, you may be best advised to wait around for the Black Friday Sales at the end of November.

During the sales this time last year, prices on handsets dropped dramatically on sites like Amazon while hundreds of offers were made available on contracts."

Smart Compose automatically finishes your sentences for you as you type, based on what Google knows about how you and others write similar sentences. Smart Compose can also auto-complete addresses for you.

Google first launched this feature with its redesigned Gmail for the web, but it's now bringing this to mobile, too. On mobile, of course, a feature like this is even more interesting since typing on mobile is obviously harder. Google says that on the web, Smart Compose is already saving people a billion characters of typing per week.

It's interesting that Google is launching this feature first on its Pixel phones. Maybe that's because those phones also feature Google's own AI chip.

In my own experience, Smart Compose is great when it works. Too often, it still doesn't, but the good thing is that you can always ignore it and go your merry way without Smart Compose's suggestions getting in your way.

Google did not say when this feature would launch, but chances are it'll go live in the next few days or weeks."

The company has since stated it would identify Duplex calls to users as Google Assistant “in certain jurisdictions” where two-party consent is required to record calls.

Google’s Phone app already filtered out calls that it suspected to be spam, but the new features should help catch even more calls from questionable numbers that plague people on a daily basis.

70,Google Home Hub hands-on: A surprisingly compact smart display,MSN UK,2018-10-09,0.957134,0.45922,"Sure, Google's new Home Hub wasn't a secret today -- but I was still surprised at just how tiny the device is in real life.

At $150, the Home Hub undercuts Amazon's Echo Show, and is only $20 more than the original, screen-less Google Home.",https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/techandscience/google-home-hub-hands-on-a-surprisingly-compact-smart-display/ar-BBOa0UV,"Sure, Google's new Home Hub wasn't a secret today -- but I was still surprised at just how tiny the device is in real life. I imagined a tablet-sized screen perched on top of something resembling the giant Google Home Max, but I couldn't have been more wrong if I tried. The Home Hub is positively dainty -- thin, light and unobtrusive. It still feels like a Google Home product, with the same acoustically transparent fabric found on the Home Mini and Max. But, the display clearly sets it apart from Google's past smart speakers.

Not surprisingly, Google made the Home Hub in four colors, all to match this year's crop of Pixel devices. There are the expected ""chalk"" and ""charcoal"" options along with the new ""sand"" pink and an aqua that sadly did not make it to the Pixel phones. The front is, naturally, dominated by the display, while on the back you'll find a mic mute switch and volume up and down buttons. And, as Google was keen to point out, there is no camera on this device, for privacy reasons.

While Google hasn't confirmed the Home Hub's screen resolution, I can say it looks very, very sharp when displaying photos. Viewing angles were solid; pictures displayed across the room looked excellent. They weren't too bright or blown out at all. Of course, we're looking at pictures chosen because they'll make this display look great, but it's good to see that it has the potential to look excellent. This is in part due to the ambient light sensor on the front of the display (Google is calling it ""Ambient EQ"" light sensor) -- it's meant to balance color temperature and brightness in changing light conditions. We'll need to test it more extensively before passing judgement, but the screen definitely looks good at first glance.

As for the speaker, it sounds better than you'd expect given its diminutive size. That doesn't mean I'd want to count on it to fill a room with high-quality sound or clearly defined bass, but it sounds good enough as a secondary speaker for playing YouTube or casual music listening in the bedroom or kitchen. It's not as good as the speakers in Amazon's Echo Show, but it does sound better than the Echo Mini. Google's offering the Home Hub with six months of YouTube Premium, which features both ad-free videos and YouTube Music's vast catalog, but it also supports other music services like Spotify and Pandora (just like the existing Home speakers). But beyond YouTube and music services, it doesn't seem like there are any other media options.

From a software perspective, the Home Hub isn't running any apps, per se. It can access Google services, of course, and it lets you control thousands of smart home devices. But Google didn't talk about how the many third-party services that work with the Google Assistant would work with the Home Hub (we're going to try and find out more on that front). Presumably, it'll still be able to respond with audio, but there just won't be anything accompanying them on the display yet.

At $150, the Home Hub undercuts Amazon's Echo Show, and is only $20 more than the original, screen-less Google Home. We'll need to spend some time with it to be sure, but the Echo Show has already proven that adding a visual component to all the questions we ask smart speakers can be very handy. Based on what Google has shown us so far, it's likely the same will be the case with the Home Hub."

We’ve already seen pictures of the device in leaks, and it looks like they were right on the money. The Pixel Slate is the new flagship device designed to work on the Chrome OS. It will come with dual front-facing speakers and a 293 ppi display, as well as 8MP front- and rear-facing cameras, and can be unlocked via fingerprint sensor. Each variant of the device will also come with an Intel processor, from a Celeron on the cheapest to a 8th Gen i7 on the most expensive.

The Pixel Slate also comes with a backlit folio keyboard with a trackpad. The keyboard has to be purchased separately, but seems to compliment the device fairly well and doubles as a cover and stand. It doesn’t need to be charged or paired with the Pixel Slate, functioning instead by a snap connector from which the device can be quickly detached.

Trond Wuellner, Google director of product management, touted the updated Chrome OS, designed for use with the touchscreen. The Pixel Slate offers a “full desktop experience, not one designed for a phone.” It also offers splitscreen and baked-in Google Assistant.

The Pixel Slate will be available later this year, starting at $599 and the most expensive option being $1,599. The Pixel keyboard comes in at $199."

75,Report: Google to launch censored Search in China despite denials,MSN UK,2018-10-10,0.929861,0.733236,"Google intends to launch a censored version of its Search app for China sometime in the next six to nine months, according to a leaked transcript from a private employee meeting held last month.

According to he didn’t quite deny involvement, and in fact admitted the company had explored the idea, but simply stated Google wasn’t “close to launching” the censored Search engine and that he was “not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project.” For example, Google should immediately end development of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.",https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/techandscience/report-google-to-launch-censored-search-in-china-despite-denials/ar-BBOaUqn,"Google intends to launch a censored version of its Search app for China sometime in the next six to nine months, according to a leaked transcript from a private employee meeting held last month.

The Intercept’s Ryan Gallagher today reported the company’s Search engine chief, Ben Gomes, held a meeting to congratulate a room full of employees working on the platform, dubbed Project Dragonfly.

According to The Intercept, Gomes talked about the launch timeline:

While we are saying it’s going to be six and nine months [to launch], the world is a very dynamic place.

He goes on to point out that the current political climate makes it difficult to pinpoint a definite timeline, but indicates employees should be ready to launch whenever a “window opens.”

These comments come in stark contrast to public statements given recently by both Gomes and Google’s chief privacy officer, Kieth Enright.

Speaking to members of Congress last month, Enright tried to skirt the issue of the Dragonfly project by playing dumb. According to he didn’t quite deny involvement, and in fact admitted the company had explored the idea, but simply stated Google wasn’t “close to launching” the censored Search engine and that he was “not clear on the contours of what is in scope or out of scope for that project.”

Gomes took the soft-denial a step further when he told the BBC “Right now all we’ve done is some exploration, but since we don’t have any plans to launch something there’s nothing much I can say about it.”

Project Dragonfly has many detractors, including the US government. Vice President Mike Pence went so far as to denounce it outright. Last week, during a speech, he said:

As we gather here, a new consensus is rising across America. More business leaders are thinking beyond the next quarter, and thinking twice before diving into the Chinese market if it means turning over their intellectual property or abetting Beijing’s oppression. But more must follow suit. For example, Google should immediately end development of the “Dragonfly” app that will strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers.

Google has already developed and is reportedly planning to launch a version of Search that censors terms like “Nobel Prize,” “democracy,” and “peaceful protest” for the citizens of the world’s most populous nation. And the company has beefed up Search with special features just for China: It’s added phone number, IP, and location tracking so that every query can be attached to a person.

In exchange for access to the Chinese market, it appears, a US company that’s already worth billions of dollars is willing to provide support for a communist government’s oppression of its people.

Among the new devices we saw two new Google Pixel 3 smartphones, the Pixel Slate tablet, and a new Google Home Hub.

One thing we didn't see was the rumoured Google Pixel Watch, which would have gone head-to-head with the recently released Samsung Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch Series 4.

Let's take a look at what happened to the Pixel Watch.

At the beginning of the year, the Google Pixel Watch seemed like a dead cert. The first news about the Pixel-branded smartwatch came from reliable technology leaker Evan Blass and a “reliable source” of his. Blass tweeted in May:

The Pixel Watch would be the culmination of everything the computing giant has learned since Android Wear launched back in 2014, Google was expected to roll up its sleeves and get stuck into the smartwatch market on its own terms, going watchface-to-watchface with Apple and Samsung.

In the same way the Nexus devices and Pixel phones were used as ""reference"" devices for the Android platform, and to control the end-to-end user experience, the Pixel Watch would have been the halo Wear OS device.

It sounds like a good idea, right? Especially as many Wear OS manufacturers are lacking in direction, and could use a reference device from Google to point them in the right direction.

Google obviously thought it was a good idea as well, as the smartwatch was clearly in development at the beginning of the year.

We even had internal codenames. As we previously reported at T3, Google used – Ling, Triton and Sardine – suggesting Google was working on three variants of the Pixel Watch.

© Provided by Future Publishing Ltd. Despite the vast number of rumours that Google was planning the release a Pixel Watch at yesterday's event, the company has spoken out to the contrary, saying that it has no plans to launch its own smartwatch this year.

“To think of a one-size-fits-all watch, I don’t think we’re there yet,” Barr said. “Our focus is on our partners for now.”

Quite simply, Wear OS, Google's wearable operating system, isn't ready for the Pixel treatment yet.

The Pixel phones are among the best Android phones because they control the end-to-end user experience, pairing the best hardware with the best software.

Even if Google was able to nail the hardware, and make a smartwatch which feel just as premium as the Apple Watch, its clear that Wear OS needs a lot of work to match the premium hardware.

Wear OS is where Google has decided to focus its efforts for now (frequent updates rather than yearly ones), and once the software is sorted then maybe we'll see a Google Pixel Watch."

This year’s smartphones have a range of impressive features, including dual front camera, with a special selfie mode.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL - including price, release date and key features.

© Phone Designer Google Pixel 3 Google announced the new phones today, and pre-orders are now open.

The new phones are likely to land in stores later this month - for November 1.

© Trinity Mirror Shared Services Limited The Google Pixel 3 has a starting price of £629 at launch. $799 for US price, that's £739 in the UK, and $77 for the stand.

This is around the same price as the Google Pixel 2, which launched in 2017.

YouTube Music is adding in for six months.

Related: Going hands-on  with the Google Pixel 3 XL (Stuff)

The new smartphones come in a choice of three colours.

These are black and white and a pink-hued design.

The Pixel 3 has a 5.4-inch screen and dimensions of 145.6 x 68.2 x 7.9mm.

The screen goes edge to edge with extra space at the top.

And while the Pixel 3 has wider bezels at the top and bottom of the screen, the Pixel 3 XL only features a bottom bezel, while at the top is a ‘notch.’

Both phones have bigger screens, though they ""feel smaller"".

The screen itself is OLED and provided by LG - just like the Pixel 2.

Unlike many rival smartphones, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL have a single-lens rear camera.

However, the front-facing camera has 8MP dual-lenses, and has a special 'Super Selfie’ mode.

The camera captures more of the scene, so you don't need long arms - you zoom out.

Other fun camera features include augmented reality capabilities, which allow you to scan in email address and business cards. Google showed how characters will also be available. There's Marvel heroes and Google is working on a Childish Gambino figure on Playground. It launches on Pixel 3 and will comes to Pixel 2 and 1 soon.

Annie Leibovitz has partnered with Google for her latest project, traveling around the country taking portraits. The series will be revealed by Google. They also gave the camera to mags to shoot seven magazine covers to test if it stood up.

Pixel Visual Core is built into Pixel 3 to make the camera smarter. There's also top shot - which makes sure you don't miss your moment.

Super res zoom will shoot a burst of photos so it gets rid of the blur and get the close up you were trying to get.

Night Sight is for low light settings, to avoid a harsh flash. In low light, Google compared to iPhone X during its presentation to show it picks out colours to avoid the dark shadow effect.

Portrait mode also changes, with more depth choice, and there's a few other adds that come with the camera.

When your friend is wearing glasses or you see shoes you like you can then browse products and similar styles to see where you can buy them.

The phone will be the first to have the system when it rolls out next month.

Both the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL use an oct-core Qualcomm chipset, an Ardreno 630 GPU and have 4GB of RAM.

Users can choose from either 64GB or 128GB options.

In terms of battery, the smartphones use a 2,915mAh battery - up from the 2,700mAh battery seen in the Pixel 2.

Call Screen is also new - if you don't want to pick up the phone answers for you and asks who is calling and why. It'll appear on screen based off their reply, you can mark it as spam. It launches today in the US and will be released elsewhere next month.

Flip to Shhh also means when you turn your phone over it quietens it.

This operating system has a number of impressive features - including squeezable sides, swipe gestures and the ability to double tap the screen to wake up the phone."

We doubt that was the case for this Peruvian woman, who has since become a divorcee after being seen cuddling up to another man on Google Street View.

This took place way back in 2013 at Puente de  Suspiros de Barranco in Lima, Peru.

The image, which is still on Google, shows a woman sitting on a bench with a man lying down next to her with his head rested on her lap.

The Daily Mail reports that the woman's now ex-husband recognised the clothes that she was wearing and eventually realised it was her.

The unnamed couple later divorced after she was confronted about her adultery, which she confessed to.

The husband later shared the images on Facebook where the woman was berated for her dishonesty.

85,Samsung Galaxy Note 10 will ditch the headphone jack for a bigger battery,MSN New Zealand,2018-10-12,0.602265,0.654442,"Samsung, one of the last smartphone manufacturers vehemently sticking with the once-ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack, looks set to ditch the port from its flagship smartphones, starting with the Note 10 next year.

If the latest report is accurate, it means the next-generation Galaxy handsets will require either USB-C earbuds, wireless headphones, or a USB-C to 3.5mm adapter akin to the one bundled with the Pixel 3.

The report, courtesy of Korean outlet ETnews, claims Samsung will drop the 3.5mm headphone port from all devices launched after autumn 2019. That means the upcoming Galaxy S10, S10 Plus could be the last flagship smartphones with the port.



Provided that Samsung sticks with its typical release schedule, the Galaxy Note 10, which usually launches in August, will likely be the first Samsung-branded handset to launch without a 3.5mm port. Following that, we can also expect a port-free Samsung Galaxy S11 in early 2020.

Samsung isn't the only 3.5mm stalwart to succumb to the trend, with OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei recently confirming the firm's next handset, dubbed OnePlus 6T, will also forgo the headphone port in favour of wired USB-C earbuds.

OnePlus said the death of the headphone port freed-up crucial space inside the body of its next flagship and allowed it to increase the size of the battery – a trade-off most phone owners are probably willing to make.

According to sources within the supply chain, Samsung is likely to make a similar argument for the removal of the headphone port. However, given that the Note 9 already packs a whopping 4000mAh battery cell – whilst maintaining the 3.5mm port – it'll be interesting to see whether Galaxy Note fans think it is worth the trade-off.

Samsung will include a free USB-C-to-3.5mm dongle in the box, ETnews reports. However, it's unclear whether Samsung will include wired USB-C headphones with its next-generation handsets, or whether it will push customers to its wireless options.

In recent years, Samsung has often highlighted the 3.5mm headphone port as a key differentiator from rival flagship smartphones – openly mocking Apple for its decision to ditch the audio port during its keynotes and television adverts.

On a more positive note, having the largest smartphone seller in the world go all-in on USB-C headphones will likely trigger greater competition among third-party manufacturers. This is likely to result in a better choice in USB-C audio accessories.

Of course, this is all just a rumour for now. Despite ETnews proving accurate for Samsung leaks in the past, there is still almost a year until the Galaxy Note 10 hits shelves worldwide and plans could change – especially if there is a backlash from loyal fans over the change."

When we deliver a foldable phone, it has to be really meaningful to our customer,” Koh told CNET yesterday, “If the user experience is not up to my standard, I don’t want to deliver those kind of products.” A developer conference seems like an odd venue for Samsung to announce a product that’s been anticipated for so many years.",https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/techandscience/samsung-says-its-foldable-phone-is-also-a-tablet-that-fits-in-your-pocket/ar-BBOh9tU,"Samsung’s mobile head, DJ Koh, has given us a first glimpse of what the company’s long-awaited foldable phone will be like to use. Speaking to CNET, the executive said that while unfolded the device will offer the functionality of a tablet complete with multi-tasking and a big screen, but can then be folded into a portable phone.

The description matches a cringe-worthy concept trailer the company released back in 2013 which showed a device with one large internal screen combined with a second smaller screen on the outside for use when folded.

Koh has previously suggested that the handset could be unveiled at Samsung’s developer conference where he will be delivering the opening keynote on November 7th. The executive said it would have to reach his standards before it could be announced.

”When we deliver a foldable phone, it has to be really meaningful to our customer,” Koh told CNET yesterday, “If the user experience is not up to my standard, I don’t want to deliver those kind of products.” Although he expected the hybrid device to initially find a niche market, he said that he believed it would expand, and that “we do need a foldable phone.”

Numerous manufacturers have stepped up with their own efforts to produce a foldable smartphone. Huawei reportedly plans to release a foldable handset in limited quantities in 2019, and Lenovo and Xiaomi have also teased their own prototypes. Finally, LG has also invested big in flexible displays, and earlier this year showed off a concept TV that rolled up into a box when not in use.

A developer conference seems like an odd venue for Samsung to announce a product that’s been anticipated for so many years. It suggests that we could see a prototype demonstrated, with the retail launch coming later after developers have had time to optimize apps for the new displays. And with the 10th anniversary of Samsung’s Galaxy smartphones coming next year, the time is certainly right for Samsung to unveil a cutting-edge design."

Larry Page, CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, and Pichai, CEO of Google itself, were invited, but both declined, spurring widespread anger from lawmakers.",https://www.msn.com/en-nz/news/techandscience/google-ceo-refuses-to-answer-detailed-questions-on-china-in-letter-to-senate/ar-BBOj8xc,"Google CEO Sundar Pichai has sent a letter to US senators addressing their concerns about his company's efforts in China. But in it, he refused to answer specific questions about the project -- a move that's ruffled lawmakers.

The project, called Dragonfly, is the company's apparent plan to build a censored search engine for China, eight years after initially retreating from the country.

Senators, including Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, have pressed Google for specific details, like how the product would operate or how the company would work with the authoritarian Chinese government.

""We are approaching these issues deliberately, and whether we would or could release a search service in China remains unclear,"" according to a copy of the letter shared with CNET by Warner's office. ""Accordingly, we are not in a position to be able to answer detailed questions.""

Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, though, Google has said it's ""not close"" to launching a search service in China, and any work it's doing in the country is ""exploratory."" The Intercept reported news of the letter earlier Friday.

On Friday, Warner chastised Google for the lack of transparency. ""I was really disappointed with Google's response to our letter,"" he said in a statement. ""Any effort to get back into China could enable the Chinese government in repressing and manipulating their citizens. Google owes us some honest answers, or it risks losing the trust of Congress and the public.""

The letter from Pichai, dated Aug. 31, was sent to Warner and Rubio. But it was also addressed to Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas; Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon; Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado; and Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey. Pichai's letter was a response to an earlier missive from the senators demanding more information on the China project.

The effort has also drawn criticism from Google's workforce. A handful of employees has reportedly quit over the initiative. And about 1,000 employees signed an open letter asking the company to be transparent about the project and to create an ethical review process for it that includes rank-and-file employees, not just high-level executives.

Google has done little to acknowledge the project. However, last month, Keith Enright, Google's chief privacy officer, confirmed during a hearing with the Senate Commerce Committee that there is indeed a Project Dragonfly, but he wouldn't elaborate.

Pichai's reluctance to answer specific questions may not win over his critics in Washington.

He's been under intense scrutiny from lawmakers since last when Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testified before the Senate over election security, disinformation and the perceived biases of the companies' algorithms. Larry Page, CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet, and Pichai, CEO of Google itself, were invited, but both declined, spurring widespread anger from lawmakers.

Pichai is expected to give his own congressional testimony next month after the midterm elections."

If Friday's nonfarm payroll report from the U.S. Labor Department reveals higher-than-expected job creation, it could spur the Fed to act quickly to stop inflation and stifle wage growth in the process, Cramer said.

Income inequality is a serious problem, and it's a problem that the Fed has absolutely had a hand in creating,"" he said. ""How the heck are working people supposed to catch up if our central bank slams on the brakes every time wages start going higher?"" he continued.

The ""Mad Money"" host pointed out the various downward pressures on wage growth, including the rise of cloud-based technology and automation and the growth of price-slashing giants like Amazon.

""When I look at Amazon, I'm seeing a company that's working to control wage inflation by embracing automation at its warehouses and eliminating monthly bonuses and stock grants,"" Cramer said.

""The semiconductor space is important,"" he said on Wednesday. ""Chips are in nearly everything these days and they need to be ordered early in the production process, so a downturn in the semis is often a leading indicator for the broader economy.""

Western Digital, formerly a pure play on hard drives, got into the semiconductor industry after its 2016 acquisition of chipmaker Sandisk. It specializes in NAND chips, a type of flash semiconductor used for data storage.

Micron deals in two types of chips, flash and dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, chips, which end up in various electronic devices including computers.

But Cramer argued that there is ""a fundamental difference"" between Western Digital and Micron. Western Digital's business is largely driven by flash memory chip sales, whereas the majority of Micron's business comes from dynamic random-access memory chips, an entirely different market.

That difference was enough for Cramer to recommend one stock over the other. Click here to find out why.

Market pessimists love to rally around overseas market drops and squawk about how they'll take down U.S. stocks, but often times, the other side of the trade ends up winning out, Cramer said Wednesday.

""Whenever you see these contagion stories, unless there's some direct connection to the U.S. banks — and there rarely is — you need to treat these pullbacks as buying opportunities,"" he told investors.

Cramer began by reevaluating the recent turmoil in Turkey, during which President Tayyip Edrogan seemingly challenged the independent nature of Turkey's central bank as it tried to stabilize the slide in the Turkish lira.

The lira's initial decline was caused in part by U.S. President Donald Trump escalating tariffs on Turkey, which, combined with the central bank's action, set the bears into a frenzy centered on how the currency crisis could affect U.S. securities.

But ""the thing about Turkey is that it's kind of been a slow motion train-wreck for ages,"" Cramer said.

Still, the bears had their way. Click here for Cramer's take on how you could've profited from the panic.

With CyrusOne fresh off its best quarter in history, some investors are wondering why the data-center-focused real estate investment trust decided to expand internationally. But President and CEO Gary Wojtaszek said his reasoning was simple.

""Data is global,"" Wojtaszek told Cramer in a Wednesday interview. ""If your kids play Fortnite, they're playing against kids all around the world, so data is flying around the world. Our customers, which are predominantly Fortune 1000 customers, are deployed everywhere globally. So if you really want to be helpful to the customers' needs, you have to have a global platform, and if you don't, you're really in an inferior position.""

Beyond that, the data center business is ""accelerating"" as major tech companies spend more on expanding data storage capacity for their growing businesses, which fuels CyrusOne's core business, Wojtaszek said.

""If you talk to any of the FANG companies or even the broader group — there's about a dozen companies that are really kind of driving this industry — everyone's capital expenditures are up dramatically,"" the CEO said, referencing Cramer's well-known acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet.

""We look at all the success that we've had in the States over the last decade and we feel really comfortable that we'll be able to export that same success internationally, because all the growth internationally is coming from all the customers that we serve here,"" Wojtaszek continued.

The auto industry is seeing a shift in consumer purchases, with more and more people opting to buy used cars rather than pay up for new ones. Naturally, Cramer wanted to steer investors in the right direction.

""If you want to see the biggest winner here, look no further than Carvana, the online used car dealership,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""This stock has pulled back pretty dramatically from its recent highs, but get this: it's still up more than 500 percent from where it bottomed a few days after its IPO roughly 18 months ago, and it's given you a terrific 185 percent gain just for 2018.""

Carvana's premise is simple. Rather than asking customers to physically go to car dealerships and spend their time fielding salesmen and filling out paperwork, the company puts all the relevant information on its website, letting people do research, secure financing or buy a car online. Once they buy, they can pick up the car from a Carvana ""vending machine,"" an automated garage that simplifies the pickup process.

The stock, however, has run a lot, and even though it's not yet expensive, investors shouldn't put their hard-earned bucks towards investing in the stock if they don't have some money to lose, Cramer said.

""I would only buy Carvana for speculation as the stock's a real wild trader,"" he said. ""You need to be prepared to be building your position gradually on the way down if it keeps falling.""

""Even after its near[ly] 25 percent decline from its recent highs, the stock remains hot, hot, hot. So, yes, you have my blessing to buy it here, just don't be too aggressive and don't buy it all at one level,"" he added.

91,Why Amazon Stock is Perfect for the Rest of the Year,MSN Money,2018-10-04,0.83361,0.825296,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN) have been on fire throughout 2018, rising an impressive 67% so far on the year.

Of course, one day the trend in Amazon stock will falter and shares will decline.

However, the bottom line is simple: Amazon stock is a buy-on-dips name until the strategy fails.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/why-amazon-stock-is-perfect-for-the-rest-of-the-year/ar-BBNV5wy?srcref=rss,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN) have been on fire throughout 2018, rising an impressive 67% so far on the year. Even more impressive, Amazon stock is up more than 100% over the past 12 months, as momentum has stayed strong in this now $1 trillion name.

That may make investors leery to invest in Amazon. It doesn’t have the balance sheet strength of Apple (AAPL), another name we like in the fourth quarter, and its valuation is wildly elevated when using traditional methods.

But here’s the thing: Amazon isn’t a traditional company. Had all those bears sold AMZN stock short five or ten years ago and stayed short they’d all be bankrupt by now as it was overvalued then too.

Clearly Amazon and its investors operate under a different set of rules. Those that want to fight it can do so at their own peril. Of course, one day the trend in Amazon stock will falter and shares will decline. It could happen next week, next month or next quarter. There’s no sure way to predict the short-term action of any stock or index.

But because of Amazon’s growing power in growing markets like ecommerce, cloud and advertising, investors continue to give CEO Jeff Bezos and his team the benefit of the doubt. Does that make it a name to hold through the end of the year?

When Amazon reports its fiscal third-quarter earnings results later this month, it will include the company’s results from Prime Day. Those results should be monstrous and help give Amazon an even greater boost to revenue. It essentially created a Black Friday shopping event in the middle of summer. Brilliant.

The company is heading into the ever-important holiday season. The conference call will be key but regardless, it should be a good fourth quarter for Amazon. That could mean good things for names like United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) as well.

Last quarter, the company’s earnings of $5.07 per share came in more than double consensus expectations. Clearly Amazon has momentum in its main business right now.

Retail will certainly be a catalyst this quarter, but so too will Amazon Web Services. We’ve seen stellar cloud growth out of companies like Adobe Systems (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (CRM) and others. Given that Amazon is atop the leaderboard in terms of market share, there’s little question that it too will continue to do well thanks to the cloud.

Cloud stocks have the wind to their backs and, as I said with Amazon earlier, eventually that wind will shift direction or at the very least die down. But until that happens, there’s no reason to bet against these stocks.

It’s impressive to see a company the size of Amazon growing at the rate it is. Expectations call for 32% revenue growth this year and almost 300% earnings growth. Still, valuing AMZN is tough, because there’s just no telling how big this juggernaut is going to become. That makes it a perfect dip-buying name.

This is where the action can get a little tricky. So far, Amazon stock remains in a strong uptrend. That’s shown by the repetitive bounces off the 50-day and uptrend support (black line).

However, with the decline in the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and as yields climb, it may be worth asking if AMZN stock will come under short-term pressure, tech stocks don’t like higher rates. If so, first see how Amazon handles trend support and the $1,900 level.

If it gives way, shares would be susceptible to a pullback to the $1,850 level. This area (highlighted on the chart as “No. 1”) is a series of three levels conveniently spaced about $100 apart.

Each level was prior resistance that eventually gave way and became support. Getting to support No. 2 seems unlikely without a poor earnings reaction later this month or a market wide correction. Support No. 3 almost certainly needs one of those two negative catalysts (or both) to get it there.

However, the bottom line is simple: Amazon stock is a buy-on-dips name until the strategy fails. If you’re long-term bearish AMZN, your best course of action may be to treat as you would your sentiment’s mascot: Leave it be.

Meanwhile, Amazon has a job posting up that promotes the ""Amazon Accelerator Program,"" which is luring manufacturers who want to create made-for-Amazon products. Another job listing from this week says the Private Brands team is seeking a leader to ""help build a new program to rapidly expand our selection.""

It all adds up to an ambitious effort by Amazon to offer brands that can't be found anywhere else, as CEO Jeff Bezos pushes his commerce site into competition with some of the world's best known consumer businesses, which also happen to be among Amazon's top partners.

""Amazon Accelerator creates new opportunities for manufacturers and offers a way for them to launch brands and products directly to Amazon customers,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""For customers, this program adds products to our assortment and allows us to offer an even wider selection of high quality products at a great value.""

Amazon has been ramping up its private label business in recent years, and now has over 120 brands that sell exclusively on its marketplace, according to TJI Research. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey estimates Amazon increased the number of those brands by more than nine-fold since early 2016 and is on pace to generate $25 billion in sales by 2022, up from $7.5 billion in 2018.

Amazon has been giving its private label products more exposure across its site. They now show up high in search results under a separate box titled ""Top Rated from Our Brands."" In recent months, Amazon has also been testing a new feature that promotes its own private label brands at the bottom of its competitors' product listings.

Companies that join Our Brands get access to marketing support and tools that track performance and customer feedback. Amazon lists over a dozen categories it's targeting with the program, ranging from toys and shoes to lawn and gardening products. After signing up for the program, participants get redirected to a page with the address ""amazon-accelerator.com,"" according to a seller who applied.

The SunTrust Robinson analysts said that by selling exclusive products, Amazon can generate better profit margins and can control the supply chain for sourcing inventory. It can also put more pressure on bigger brands to reduce their prices on Amazon to stay competitive.

""This trend should not only differentiate Amazon's offering, improve the user experience and help grow retention, but also prove accretive to margins, which through reinvestment, should reinforce Amazon's moat,"" the note said.

The accelerator could also help Amazon improve the quality of its private label products. Amazon's exclusive brand portfolio in the apparel category had the lowest customer satisfaction score versus the largest U.S. apparel makers, according to a recent report by research firm CFRA."

Counterfeits on Amazon ""enhance its market power over suppliers,"" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has studied the impact of intellectual property infringement on small companies.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/extra-inventory-more-sales-lower-prices-how-counterfeits-benefit-amazon/ar-BBNGRqk?srcref=rss,"CUYAHOGA FALLS, Ohio - Jon Fawcett wanted to build a cellphone cable that wouldn't fray. So he developed a charging cord wrapped in stainless steel sturdy enough to withstand an electric chainsaw.

It was a niche product that turned Fuse Chicken, Fawcett's company of half-a-dozen employees, into a quick success. Customers raved about Fawcett's durable designs - until he started selling them on Amazon.

Fawcett's customer reviews plummeted without warning. In came a deluge of one-star pans.

""Really bad quality,"" read a description of an iPhone car charger in a review titled, ""Broke in a week.""

Fawcett was dumbfounded. Then he found a clue in one of the reviews: a picture of a charger emblazoned with a Fuse Chicken logo that wasn't quite right.

Over the following months, Fawcett placed numerous Amazon orders for his own merchandise. What he found would become the basis of a lawsuit he filed last year against Amazon.

Mixed in with Amazon's inventory of authentic merchandise were crude copycats. Some looked like the real thing, but didn't include Fuse Chicken's name. Others bore the name, but weren't made by his company, Fawcett said in an interview with The Times in his Ohio office.

His experiment suggests there is no way for even the savviest Amazon shopper to avoid the threat of counterfeits. The goods may look real online, but there is no guarantee of authenticity - whether sold by a brand, a third-party seller or Amazon's direct-sales arm.

""That's when I recognized how big the problem was,"" said Fawcett, 43. Products were ""being thrown into a single bin in Amazon's warehouse, real and fake.""

Amazon, in court filings, denied mixing knockoff Fuse Chicken products with genuine ones. The company says it has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to counterfeits and aggressively pursues legal action against bad actors.

Rather than come to Fawcett's defense, Amazon plunged the small-business owner into a Kafkaesque back-and-forth that has become something of a rite of passage for those who fall victim to intellectual property infringement on the world's biggest e-commerce site.

Pleas to audit Amazon's inventory and remove unfair reviews were dismissed. Attempts to garner help from Amazon to learn more about the origins of the knockoff goods went nowhere.

Fawcett flooded Amazon with more goods in a desperate bid to dilute the pool of counterfeits. When an Amazon staffer eventually contacted him, it was to urge him to lower his prices to match the alternatives - products he irately pointed out were cheaper because they were fake.

""It's gotten to that level of insanity dealing with Amazon,"" said Fawcett, who estimates lost sales in the tens of thousands of dollars, but mostly fears the lasting harm of the bad reviews.

Fawcett's Cuyahoga Falls brand, which launched after a $9,800 Kickstarter campaign, now faces a formidable opponent in court. Amazon's outside counsel is the same high-powered Washington firm that's represented Philip Morris, Halliburton and Huawei.

""We felt there was no choice,"" Fawcett said. ""We don't have anything to hide. When you have the truth on your side it makes the bully less intimidating.""

No company has done more to legitimize online shopping than Amazon.

By offering low prices, a vast inventory and the convenience of home delivery, the technology giant helped lead a generation away from brick-and-mortar stores and normalize shopping with a click of a button.

It has made e-commerce accessible to more than a million small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S., creating 900,000 jobs, according to Amazon. More than 20,000 small- and medium-sized businesses worldwide reached sales in excess of $1 million last year on its platform, the company said.

So ingrained is Amazon in our purchasing habits that more than half of all product searches begin on the site rather than alternatives such as Google. The world's second-most valuable company by market capitalization behind Apple Inc. is on pace to capture half of all online sales in the U.S this year, according to research firm eMarketer.

Amazon's market dominance gives it the power to influence the future of retail. How it handles counterfeiters could shape the behavior of the entire industry, experts say.

The sale of fake goods is at least a $461-billion global industry and expanding, in no small part because of the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon and China's Alibaba.

Customs agents had a fighting chance when pirated goods predominantly arrived in cargo containers. But with the rise of e-commerce, counterfeiters and their middlemen can ship goods in parcels too innumerable to catch.

""They're like ants,"" said Piotr Stryszowski, an economist for the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. ""They're too small for customs officers to focus on one. Yet they accumulate into a huge number.""

There's little authorities can do apart from name and shame offenders. Alibaba's primary platform Taobao has repeatedly been included in the United States Trade Representative's list of ""Notorious Markets"" for selling counterfeits.

Then there's Amazon. Not only has the platform avoided any serious backlash for allowing the sale of fake goods, it's actually thrived from it, say more than two dozen brand owners, e-commerce consultants, attorneys, investigators and public policy experts.

Sellers of fake goods pay transaction and shipping fees just like legitimate businesses. But counterfeits also help Amazon's bottom line in other ways.

The company aspires to be the store of first resort for everything, which means it needs as many brands and sellers as it can get, all offering goods at low prices. Counterfeiters help pressure brands to sell their wares on the site. Companies that avoid Amazon risk letting counterfeiters determine how their goods appear to customers on the most influential e-commerce site - ceding control, for instance, of which pictures are used to promote a product and which colors and sizes are offered.

The spread of cheaper knockoffs can also put pressure on authentic sellers and brands to lower their prices, helping Amazon win more customers.

The company has resisted calls to do more to police its site and address claims by businesses that they are losing millions in lost sales and reputational harm, according to experts.

Brands have typically shied away from suing Amazon. Courts have ruled the company isn't liable when counterfeits are sold on its platform and that plaintiffs must instead go after the sellers of fakes. Many accept piracy as a cost of doing business.

""If you're a small company, you have to be on Amazon,"" said Jeffrey Brown, who cut the price of his $25 chilled water bowls for pets, FrostyBowlz, in half to compete with the deluge of copycats. ""It's both a huge outlet for our product and a nightmare.""

Cutting ties means losing access to hundreds of millions of Amazon customers - and it doesn't solve the problem.

Birkenstock left Amazon two years ago after it grew exasperated with counterfeits, but the move did little to stem the flow of both real and fake versions of the company's footwear on the platform.

Counterfeits on Amazon ""enhance its market power over suppliers,"" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the non-profit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which has studied the impact of intellectual property infringement on small companies. ""Counterfeits help Amazon, and that's why they're reluctant to act on them.""

Amazon disputes it benefits from counterfeits and says it has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to fakes. It's investing in machine-learning tools to weed out counterfeits. It offers a program called Brand Registry, which is supposed to give sellers and intellectual property owners more control of their listings. It says more than 99.9% of Amazon page views go to sellers that have never been accused of infringement. And shoppers can request refunds if they receive a knockoff.

""We strictly prohibit the sale of counterfeit products and invest heavily - both funds and company energy - to ensure our policy against the sale of such products is followed,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement. ""Customers trust that they will receive authentic goods when they shop on Amazon and anything that diminishes that trust is unacceptable.""

Amazon's ascendance as the world's dominant online retailer may have been sealed when it recognized it was far more profitable to let other people sell goods than selling merchandise itself.

Amazon Marketplace, launched in 2000, allowed anyone to sign up and sell on its site. It marked a major change in strategy for the company, which was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994 as an online bookseller.

By welcoming third-party sellers, Amazon vastly increased its inventory without a commensurate increase in its overhead needed to procure, store and ship goods.

Amazon could reap profits by charging independent sellers access to its fulfillment centers - now the backbone of its Prime subscription service, which famously offers free two-day shipping.

Combined with transaction fees, fulfillment services and advertising, Amazon can take up to half a seller's revenue. By comparison, Amazon earns less than 5% profit margins on goods it sells directly, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder and chief executive of Marketplace Pulse, an e-commerce analytics firm. Amazon declined to verify its profit margin.

Third-party sellers now account for more than half the goods sold on Amazon. The company's revenue swelled to $178 billion last year, with $118.5 billion coming from product sales rather than services such as cloud computing. Amazon has recorded a profit every quarter since early 2015. Meanwhile, Bezos was recently named the richest man in modern history.

But for all the success the Marketplace has wrought, it remains one of Amazon's biggest sources of controversy and risk. The service is often described as a messy free-for-all - a flea market run amok where up to 5 million vendors from across the world ferociously compete to sell the cheapest toothbrush or beach towel.

Here, any edge counts. Fake customer reviews are bought to boost a seller's search results or cripple a competitor. False infringement claims are filed to temporarily shutdown a rival. And bots are programmed to undercut a seller's price just enough to steal a position in the all-important ""buy box"" that goads shoppers to add items to purchase. Amazon says it's working hard to crack down on abuse and has gone so far as to sue people responsible for fake reviews.

""People don't see the chaos behind the listings,"" said Kaziukenas, whose firm tracks tens of millions of sellers and brands online.

Amazon's business model, he said, forced brands to compete on a global scale rather than only with rivals next to them on store shelves.

""You have millions of businesses all over the world going after you all the time,"" Kaziukenas said.

That includes hundreds of thousands of sellers in China, the world's largest producer of consumer goods, real and fake.

The risk and reward of China

For decades, even as the ""Made in China"" label proliferated, Chinese manufacturers earned just a small portion of sales while the lion's share went to retailers and brands.

E-commerce changed that by giving Chinese factories and merchants direct access to the U.S., the biggest consumer economy in the world.

Amazon, which had failed to penetrate China's tightly guarded domestic e-commerce market, instead focused on wooing Chinese exporters to fuel its Marketplace, market research firms and e-commerce consultants say.

Amazon obtained permission in 2015 to ship goods out of China, which allowed Chinese sellers to tap into Amazon's logistical services. Of the 1 million new sellers that joined the Marketplace between 2015 and 2017, about 300,000 were from China, Kaziukenas estimates.

Enlisting legions of Chinese sellers provided the scale Amazon sought, but its drawbacks were predictable. China and Hong Kong are the origin of more than 80% of the world's supply of fake goods, according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

It's often difficult for U.S. brands to sue Chinese counterfeiters, who regularly falsify the contact information they provide Amazon.

To open a store, all that's required is a business name, an address, a phone number, a government-issued ID and an international credit card.

The simplicity is by design, said Damon McCoy, a professor of computer science at New York University who has researched the role of bots in the counterfeit trade and has held meetings with Amazon on behalf of brand clients.

Any friction in signing up would stunt the Marketplace's growth. It's why McCoy says Amazon does little to vet sellers and their goods beforehand.

""Their stance on counterfeits is often reactive rather than proactive,"" he said.

Amazon disagrees and said its software can block counterfeiters before they join the Marketplace.

""When a business registers to sell products through Amazon's Marketplace, Amazon's systems scan information for signals that the business might be a bad actor, and Amazon blocks identified bad actors before they can offer any products for sale,"" the company said in a statement.

McCoy said if Amazon shutters one store for selling knockoffs, the owner often shifts operations to another.

""Amazon on their backend can see hundreds of other shops being paid by the same bank account, yet they don't close them down,"" McCoy said. ""Instead, they just go after the one shop that was reported.""

Experts say a counterfeiter can have access to dozens, if not hundreds, of stores - often with incomprehensible names.

""I see an alphabet soup of names that looks like someone just pounded on a keyboard,"" said Craig Crosby, a former LAPD investigator who founded a consumer advocacy website called the Counterfeit Report. ""They're constantly being taken down only to come back again.""

Amazon says its software can block infringers with multiple stores. The company declined to further comment on its practices, including whether it checks bank account information.

But brands say the same fraudsters keep showing up under different names - a burden for smaller companies that have to invest in hiring employees just to scan Amazon and other e-commerce sites daily for IP violators.

Experts say it's impossible to know how many counterfeit goods are on Amazon without examining every product for sale.

Crosby, who is hired by brands to police Amazon, says his company alone has had nearly 36,000 listings removed the last two years encompassing all manner of goods, including flashlights, memory cards, iPhone cases, razor blades, cologne and even a gunsight.

""It's a game of Whac-A-Mole,"" said Corey Nielsen, maker of the Shoulder Dolly, straps used for safely lifting heavy furniture and appliances.

Nielsen, whose Colorado brand has long been targeted by fakes, says he's not afraid of the global competition. What he can't stand is how the Marketplace provides counterfeiters with the means to flourish.

""Amazon is not acting honorably,"" Nielsen said. ""I can accept a level playing field. But this is guerrilla warfare.""

Nielsen's chief rival is Mark Lopreiato, owner of the Baldwin Park-based Forearm Forklift. Over the last two decades, the entrepreneurs have popularized the furniture lifting strap, which is sold by the likes of Home Depot, Walmart and U-Haul. The two competitors have formed a friendly relationship over their frustrations with Amazon.

It didn't start out that way for Lopreiato. Amazon gave him a bigger audience than he ever could have dreamed of when he was still hustling his way through trade shows putting on demonstrations where he'd lift a refrigerator.

Lopreiato was pulling in more than $2.4 million in revenue in 2008. But only a few years later, the Marketplace was overrun by fakes priced at a fraction of the cost of Lopreiato's $20 straps.

So brazen were Lopreiato's counterfeiters that they copied Forearm Forklift's marketing material, including photographs of his employees and wife lifting bulky furniture and appliances. Many fake versions were listed alongside Forearm Forklift's promoted listings as cheaper  stores would complain to Lopreiato that they saw his goods cheaper online, not realizing they had seen fakes. Even teachers and parents at the school Lopreiato's children attended said they had bought shoddy straps thinking they were genuine.

By 2015, Forearm Forklift's annual revenue had dwindled to $1.4 million. Lopreiato laid off half his employees, consolidated his seven warehouses into one and sold his bike and watch to make ends meet.

Lopreiato became one of Amazon's most outspoken critics, detailing his plight with counterfeiters on cable TV the following year. Shortly after, Amazon sued sellers of Forearm Forklift knockoffs. Amazon won $60,000 in damages and gave it all to Lopreiato in June. He welcomed the gesture, but said its a fraction of what he's owed given the multitude of fakes that have undermined his business.

Forearm Forklift now has a staff of 18, down from 52 at the company's peak. Business has bounced back somewhat thanks to online sales, including on Amazon, but the company has lost a slew of distributors. Lopreiato blames it on counterfeiters, who he says have sullied his brand's reputation and driven down prices.

""We cannot compete with people stealing our IP,"" he said.

One Forearm Forklift employee's sole job is to compile a daily list of infringers, and then instigate the often weeks-long process of having Amazon take them down. She submits an average of 100 requests a month.

Lopreiato's office is littered with Amazon packages stuffed with copycats he's ordered himself. Some are hard to detect, requiring knowledge of the weave and UV coating Loprieato uses. Others are more obvious, neglecting to include the black felt padding that puts less stress on the shoulders.

""There are hundreds of boxes,"" Lopreiato said. ""I keep thinking I'll need them when I have my day in court.""

He knows that won't come anytime soon. Not only is he turned off by the specter of a legal fight against the deep-pocketed giant, but he also knows Amazon has the law on its side.

When a YouTube or Facebook user uploads a pirated film, the companies are not at fault.

They can thank the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which grants platforms safe harbor if their users infringe on copyrights. The law hinges on the premise that it would be too hard to vet everything that crosses their networks. All the platforms need to do is prove they had no prior knowledge of the objectionable content and worked quickly to remove it after being notified.

That has allowed platforms to grow exponentially, helping to give us the internet as we know it today. It has also shielded Amazon when counterfeit products are sold on its site.

In 2004, a federal court ruled that Amazon wasn't liable for users uploading unlicensed pictures. That precedent was upheld last year when a federal appeals court affirmed the dismissal of a lawsuit brought against Amazon by a children's pillow brand called Milo & Gabby. The husband-and-wife owners argued Amazon facilitated the sale of Chinese counterfeits; Amazon disagreed on the grounds it just provided a venue and that it was the counterfeiter who broke the law.

The judge agreed with Amazon, but not without reservations.

The ""Court is troubled by its conclusion and the impact it may have on the many small retail sellers in similar circumstances to the Plaintiffs,"" U.S. District Judge Ricardo S. Martinez wrote in his opinion. ""There is no doubt that we now live in a time where the law lags behind technology.""

The law incentivizes willful blindness, said Kaziukenas and other experts. It's less costly and time-consuming, they argue, for Amazon to address counterfeiters once they've been discovered than it is to implement a strict vetting process.

Amazon's stance isn't just frustrating tiny companies - it's also irking huge tech giants.

Apple, for instance, included a number of embarrassing details about Amazon in its 2016 lawsuit against Mobile Star, a New Jersey wholesaler accused of supplying fake and dangerous counterfeits to Groupon and Amazon.

Apple said it identifies and reports thousands of infringing products on Amazon each month. During a nine-month period, the company said it purchased ""well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon's 'Fulfillment by Amazon' program.""

More than 90% turned out to be counterfeit.

E-mails submitted as exhibits in the case also revealed mounting frustration with Amazon's lackluster response.

""It has now been 5 weeks since we first notified Amazon of its direct sales of counterfeit Apple products,"" Apple attorney Marianne David wrote. ""Amazon still has not provided any information about how it came to be selling these counterfeit Apple products directly or any of the information we requested about source, sales or remaining inventory. We are concerned that Amazon is not taking this issue seriously.""

Amazon said it has since resolved the dispute.

""In this case, we worked collaboratively to hold the vendor that provided the inauthentic goods accountable,"" Amazon said in a statement.

Apple's frustration is echoed by many brands and rights holders, who say Amazon has a penchant for dragging its feet in court and responding slowly to takedown requests. Amazon denies that and says it has staff around the world working 24 hours a day, ready to take action on reports of infringement.

Publishers such as McGraw Hill and Pearson say Amazon has been too slow to provide information about more than two dozen sellers of counterfeit textbooks included in a lawsuit filed last year against the merchants, court filings show.

""Given Amazon's well-known ability to ship goods to anywhere in the country within a single day, Amazon has no excuse for not producing the requested documents and inventory by now,"" an attorney for the publishers wrote to the court in May.

Both sides declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

When a product is labeled ""Shipped from and sold by Amazon"" it's supposed to lend an air of authenticity.

That's why Fawcett, of Fuse Chicken, was stunned when he discovered his counterfeits in late 2016. How could there be fakes if he was Amazon's only known supplier for direct sales, he wondered.

Fuse Chicken's lawsuit, now making its way through federal court in northern Ohio, represents one of the few attempts to strike Amazon where it might be legally vulnerable. Unlike with fake goods sold through the Marketplace, Amazon may not be shielded when it sells counterfeits directly.

""It's no longer safe harbor,"" Fawcett said.

Daimler AG filed a similar lawsuit last year, alleging Amazon directly sold counterfeit Mercedes hubcaps - and that it's largely automated reporting system was woefully inadequate for addressing the scale of Amazon's problem with fake goods.

""Amazon refuses to take reasonable steps to police intellectual property infringement or to source their 'shipped from and sold by Amazon.com' products only from authorized manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers,"" the German automaker said in its complaint.

Amazon, in court filings, denied the allegation. The lawsuit is ongoing.

At the root of the problem, experts say, is the pressure to fulfill Prime subscribers' two-day delivery. To do that, Amazon must have enough inventory nearby at all times.

One solution has been Amazon's practice of lumping different sellers' goods together in their fulfillment centers so that there's always plenty on hand. Customers may order headphones from one seller, but actually receive headphones originating from another. The strategy works if the headphones are identical.

Co-mingling, as it's called, is common in the Marketplace and Amazon acknowledges the practice in its answer to Fuse Chicken's complaint. But Fuse Chicken's suit alleges it's also happening with inventory for Amazon's direct sales. In e-mail correspondence with Fawcett, an Amazon official revealed there was another supplier of Fuse Chicken products for direct sales.

""It appears there was a major distributor that Amazon was buying from since their price to us was much lower than what you were offering,"" Jeremiah Price, a business development manager for Amazon, wrote in November 2016.

""I'm not sure how a distributor was getting such good margins on those three products, but the system will always order from the vendor giving us the best price for the same product,"" Price wrote.

Fawcett demanded Amazon stop offering Fuse Chicken products supplied by outside vendors until everything in its warehouses could be authenticated. Amazon refused.

""The moment you start getting counterfeits as significant as we did, especially when they were 'Shipped from and sold by Amazon,' you have to make drastic changes in how you address it,"" Fawcett said. ""You no longer can accept it as business as usual.""

Fawcett now laser etches each of his products with a serial number. Customers must register the serial number to be eligible for an extended warranty.

Even today, fakes keep showing up. One recent clue, Fawcett said, was when a customer input as a serial number: ""Unknown.""

Amazon is angling for a piece of the $83 billion homebuilding industry with its latest investment in Plant Prefab, a Rialto, Calif.-based modular home manufacturer.

Trillion-dollar Amazon dipped into its venture capital account, known as The Alexa Fund, to back the startup, which uses automation to build more cost-efficient homes. Based on Amazon’s smart home investment track record, it appears that the company not only sees potential in the smart home market — expected to grow to $53 billion by 2022, according to CNBC — but wants to be a frontrunner.

The $6.7 million investment boon for Plant Prefab comes after Amazon recently launched more Alexa-connected devices, including a microwave. It’s speculated that Alexa’s presence will be cemented in every Plant Prefab home and the technology will be fully integrated.

Many of Plant Prefab’s homes can be assembled and delivered for less than $500,000, and prices run the gamut from $160,000 for a modest 400-square-foot one-bedroom to $1.23 million for a five-bedroom, 3,100-square-foot house. As it stands, customers interested in Plant Prefab homes must coordinate directly with the company. No word yet if the homes are going to pop up in Amazon’s marketplace or be eligible for Prime discounts.

By market cap, it trails Apple. Measured by number of employees, it's behind Walmart. By revenues, it's a distant eighth on the Fortune 500 list. But measured by importance to modern life and ability to shape the American economy in its own image, Amazon is second to none.

Part of Amazon's remarkable influence stems from the sheer variety of its business lines and the way it touches our everyday lives. Born in 1994 as a modest online bookseller, Amazon has grown organically and by accretion into an internet giant that plays in nearly every sector, from producing movies to transporting freight.

It has a full suite of electronic devices, including a digital assistant that thousands of consumers rely on to perform daily tasks (Alexa), an electronic reader (Kindle) and a home security system (Ring). Its server business hosts a third of the world's cloud-based data. After deflating brick-and-mortar retail, it's become a brick-and-mortar retailer itself with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, its physical bookstores, and its foray into cashierless convenience stores. Now, it's trying to become the place where you can find a handyman and fill your prescriptions, maybe even buy home insurance and get a loan.

All of that growth has helped make the man behind Amazon, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, with a net worth of $160.2 billion, according to Forbes — although that goes up or down with the company's stock price each day.

Welcome to the United States of Amazon.

In the upcoming weeks, CNN Business will examine the many ways Amazon has permeated the American economy — from the benefits it brings to the risks its vast influence poses.

After all, most consumers delight in the ability to get the world delivered to their doorstep in as little as two days (with 5% cash back on an Amazon credit card to boot). The Prime membership is the price of admission to a new level of convenience, cost savings and choice, from discounts in the grocery aisle to instant access to award-winning movies and television shows.

""The number one thing that has made us successful, by far, is obsessive-compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to obsession over the competitor,"" said Bezos, at an Economic Club of Washington dinner in September.

But there's a downside when one company has that much leverage. The company's enormous workforce and economic influence mean it has the power to squeeze wages and even warp the political process, as evidenced by the billions of dollars in tax breaks Amazon has already received for its fulfillment centers and the goodies currently in the offing for its second headquarters.

Large, diversified holding companies are nothing new. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, India's Tata Group and South Korea's Samsung touch on many parts of the global economy.

But Amazon is different. It strategically connects and leverages enough information about your behaviors in one part of your life to make predictions about what you might need in another. By doing so, it captures more of your disposable income across industries.

""They were, from the start, not really in the books business,"" says Daniel Raff, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""They understood that the web site was a source of information for them about who their customers were, and their customers' search behavior and price sensitivity.""

Since 2005, that information has been concentrated around Amazon's most powerful innovation: The Prime membership, which offers a slate of benefits that incentivize consumers to consolidate as many of their purchases as possible within Amazon's ecosystem. Kantar Consulting estimates that in late 2017, about 57 million households in the United States paid $99 a year — and $119, as of this April — for access to exclusive television content, discounts at Whole Foods, and of course, fast free shipping.

That last perk is what has set Amazon apart from the e-commerce competition. Raff compares Amazon to a mid-20th century Sears Roebuck, the catalog company that shipped a universe of consumer goods from the center of America's rail network in Chicago to anyone within reach of a mail truck. But rather than aggregating through a central hub, Amazon has built its own distributed empire of warehouses. Staffed by armies of workers and, more recently, robots, this network allows the company to deliver packages nearly as quickly as a shopper clicks ""Buy.""

It's an expensive project. According to a 2017 study by a team of economists, Amazon spent billions building and operating more than 100 fulfillment centers between 2006 and 2018. But that investment has paid off big time: The researchers estimated that this new infrastructure allowed Amazon to increase its profit margin by between 5% and 14% over that same period by shortening travel distances and reducing the number of transfer points required to get the buyer their brown box.

Amazon's aggressive investment in its fulfillment network is just one way in which the company has enjoyed the full confidence of Wall Street while never paying a dividend to shareholders.

The company only started booking profits consistently in 2015, boosted by cloud computing — that is, Amazon Web Services, a data hosting business that generated $6 billion in revenue last quarter.

As legal scholar Lina Khan argued in a 2017 Yale Law Journal note, investors tolerated the company's near-zero profit margins for decades because they knew that revenues were being reinvested in establishing what Bezos calls ""market leadership,"" which will support an ""enduring franchise.""

Much of that reinvestment goes into real innovation. In July alone, Amazon published approximately 49 new patents, including one that would facilitate the display of targeted advertisements to a customer picking up items at an Amazon locker and another that would let drones communicate with each other in the air. 



Yet a growing number of voices, from commentators like former New Republic editor Franklin Foer and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman to think tanks like the Open Markets Institute and Roosevelt Institute, see those terms as code for ""monopoly power.""

As much as Amazon has created a wonderland of options for consumers, its increasing dominance poses a challenge for those who have a product to sell. Sellers can scarcely afford not to have a presence on the site. But selling through Amazon can mean giving away control over pricing, as well as paying for advertising, for expedited help with any problems and for shipping and returns for customers who complain for any reason.

For third-party sellers, Amazon charges several fees — either on a per-item basis or as a percentage of sales. There are also monthly membership fees, as well as extra fees for promotions like Prime Day and Lightning Deals.

""It's a pay-to-play model,"" says Troy Johnston, a former Amazon seller who now provides software to help other sellers optimize their performance on the site. ""They find ways to add in a fee for every bit of access.""

As a result, sellers gain exposure to an enormous audience and higher sales. But they lose some of their ability to maintain their profit margins, putting downward pressure on wages and driving less-efficient companies out of business entirely.

In terms of the economics, which is concerned more with aggregate welfare than equity or fairness to certain individuals, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But it causes pain for those on the the losing end — especially brick-and-mortar businesses that can't compete with Amazon's fast online deliveries, hard-to-beat prices and near-infinite variety. And having created a portal through which so much commerce must flow, Amazon enriches itself by charging a toll along the way.

In a way, Amazon is doing the same thing in its search for a location for its new headquarters. It's treating prospective host cities as if they were sellers on Amazon, drawing them into a bidding war. Those cities are offering up tax breaks and subsidies, even if doing so jeopardizes their future tax revenue and drives up the price of housing for everyone else.

Amazon, and e-commerce more generally, is also disrupting the labor market. Brick and mortar retail jobs are quickly falling behind employment growth for the rest of the economy. It's not yet clear whether all the warehouse pickers and delivery drivers Amazon is hiring to support its ever growing shipping commitments will totally close that gap — especially as Amazon perfects fulfillment center robots and delivery drones in order to reduce its personnel needs in the future.

Although Amazon this week announced a new $15 minimum wage for all its employees, some research suggests that consolidating jobs under fewer large employers tends to reduce wages, not raise them.

Ultimately, government regulators may be the only force that can check Amazon's growth.

""Will Amazon get to a point where antitrust officials get nervous? Absolutely,"" says Jim Cortada, a senior research fellow at the Center for the History of Information Technology at the University of Minnesota. 



Despite a long-term shift in the United States' competition policy toward tolerating big companies as long as they benefit ""consumer welfare,"" Cortada notes that European regulators have taken a dimmer view of emerging US tech giants. Any case against Amazon, he said, would have worldwide implications.

That's partially why Amazon has ramped up its spending on lobbying in both Washington and Brussels, paying close attention to any developments in antitrust enforcement.

When asked about the prospect of regulators deciding to put a damper on Amazon's growth, Bezos typically says he's not concerned.

""All big institutions of any kind are going to be and should be examined, scrutinized, inspected. It's what we as a society want to have happen,"" he said at an Economic Club of Washington dinner in September. ""Whatever regulations are promulgated, that will not stop us from serving customers. Under all regulatory frameworks I can imagine, customers are still going to want low prices, they're still going to want fast delivery, they're still going to want big selection.""

As its hotly contested and widely publicized search for a second headquarters draws to a close, CNN Business is taking a top-to-bottom look at Amazon's present — and what it means to our future in its series, The United States of Amazon."

As part of its response to the incident, the Alphabet Inc. unit plans to announce a sweeping set of data privacy measures that include permanently shutting down all consumer functionality of Google+, the people said. The move effectively puts the final nail in the coffin of a product that was launched in 2011 to challenge Facebook Inc. and is widely seen as one of Google’s biggest failures.

A software glitch in the social site gave outside developers potential access to private Google+ profile data between 2015 and March 2018, when internal investigators discovered and fixed the issue, according to the documents and people briefed on the incident. A memo reviewed by the Journal prepared by Google’s legal and policy staff and shared with senior executives warned that disclosing the incident would likely trigger “immediate regulatory interest” and invite comparisons to Facebook’s leak of user information to data firm Cambridge Analytica.



Chief Executive Sundar Pichai was briefed on the plan not to notify users after an internal committee had reached that decision, the people said.

The planned closure of Google+ is part of a broader review of privacy practices by Google that has determined the company needs tighter controls on several major products, the people said. In an announcement Monday, the company is expected to say it is curtailing the access it gives outside developers to user data on Android smartphones and Gmail, the people said.

The episode involving Google+, which hasn’t been previously reported, shows the company’s concerted efforts to avoid public scrutiny of how it handles user information, particularly at a time when regulators and consumer privacy groups are leading a charge to hold tech giants accountable for the vast power they wield over the personal data of billions of people.

The snafu threatens to give Google a black eye on privacy after public assurances that it was less susceptible to data gaffes like those that have befallen Facebook. It may also complicate Google’s attempts to stave off unfavorable regulation in Washington. Mr. Pichai recently agreed to testify before Congress in the coming weeks.

“Whenever user data may have been affected, we go beyond our legal requirements and apply several criteria focused on our users in determining whether to provide notice,” a Google spokesman said in a statement.

In weighing whether to disclose the incident, the company considered “whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response,” he said. “None of these thresholds were met here.”

The internal memo from legal and policy staff says the company has no evidence that any outside developers misused the data but acknowledges it has no way of knowing for sure. The profile data that was exposed included full names, email addresses, birth dates, gender, profile photos, places lived, occupation and relationship status; it didn’t include phone numbers, email messages, timeline posts, direct messages or any other type of communication data, one of the people said.

Google makes user data available to outside developers through more than 130 different public channels known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. These tools usually require a user’s permission to access any information, but they can be misused by unscrupulous actors posing as app developers to gain access to sensitive personal data.

A privacy task force formed inside Google, code named Project Strobe, has in recent months conducted a companywide audit of the company’s APIs, according to the people briefed on the process. The group is made up of more than 100 engineers, product managers and lawyers, the people said.

In the announcement expected on Monday, Google plans to clamp down on the data it provides outside developers through APIs, two people briefed on the matter said. The company will stop letting most outside developers gain access to SMS messaging data, call log data and some forms of contact data on Android phones, and Gmail will only permit a small number of developers to continue building add-ons for the email service, the people said.

Google faced pressure to rein in developer access to Gmail earlier this year, after a Wall Street Journal examination found that developers commonly use free email apps to hook users into giving up access to their inboxes without clearly stating what data they collect. In some cases, employees at these app companies have read people’s actual emails to improve their software algorithms.

The coming changes are evidence of a larger rethinking of data privacy at Google, which has in the past placed relatively few restrictions on how external apps access users’ data, provided those users give permission. Restricting access to APIs will hurt some developers who have been helping Google build a universe of useful apps.

The Google+ data problem, discovered as part of the Strobe audit, was the result of a flaw in an API Google created to help app developers access an array of profile and contact information about the people who sign up to use their apps, as well as the people they are connected to on Google+. When a user grants a developer permission, any of the data they entered into a Google+ profile can be collected by the developer.

In March of this year, Google discovered that Google+ also permitted developers to retrieve the data of some users who never intended to share it publicly, according to the memo and two people briefed on the matter. Because of a bug in the API, developers could collect the profile data of their users’ friends even if that data was explicitly marked nonpublic in Google’s privacy settings, the people said.

During a two-week period in late March, Google ran tests to determine the impact of the bug, one of the people said. It found 496,951 users who had shared private profile data with a friend could have had that data accessed by an outside developer, the person said. Some of the individuals whose data was exposed to potential misuse included paying users of G Suite, a set of productivity tools including Google Docs and Drive, the person said. G Suite customers include businesses, schools and governments.

Because the company kept a limited set of activity logs, it was unable to determine which users were affected and what types of data may potentially have been improperly collected, the two people briefed on the matter said. The bug existed since 2015, and it is unclear whether a larger number of users may have been affected over that time.

Google believes up to 438 applications had access to the unauthorized Google+ data, the people said. Strobe investigators, after testing some of the apps and checking to see if any of the developers had previous complaints against them, determined none of the developers looked suspicious, the people said. The company’s ability to determine what was done with the data was limited because the company doesn’t have “audit rights” over its developers, the memo said. The company didn’t call or visit with any of the developers, the people said.

The question of whether to notify users went before Google’s Privacy and Data Protection Office, a council of top product executives who oversee key decisions relating to privacy, the people said.

Internal lawyers advised that Google wasn’t legally required to disclose the incident to the public, the people said. Because the company didn’t know what developers may have what data, the group also didn’t believe notifying users would give any actionable benefit to the end users, the people said.

The memo from legal and policy staff wasn’t a factor in the decision, said a person familiar with the process, but reflected internal disagreements over how to handle the matter.

The document shows Google officials knew that disclosure could have serious ramifications. Revealing the incident would likely result “in us coming into the spotlight alongside or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed under the radar throughout the Cambridge Analytica scandal,” the memo said. It “almost guarantees Sundar will testify before Congress.”

A range of factors go into determining whether a company must notify users of a potential data breach. There is no federal breach notification law in the U.S., so companies must navigate a patchwork of state laws with differing standards, said Al Saikali, a lawyer with Shook, Hardy & Bacon LLP. He isn’t affiliated with any of the parties.

While many companies wouldn’t notify users if a name and birth date were accessed, some firms would, Mr. Saikali said. Some firms notify users even when it is unclear that the data in question was accessed, he said. “Fifty percent of the cases I work on are judgment calls,” he said. “Only about half the time do you get conclusive evidence that says that this bad guy did access information.”

Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May of this year, requires companies to notify regulators of breaches within 72 hours, under threat of a maximum fine of 2% of world-wide revenue. The information potentially leaked via Google’s API would constitute personal information under GDPR, but because the problem was discovered in March, it wouldn’t have been covered under the European regulation, Mr.Saikali said.

Google could also face class action lawsuits over its decision not to disclose the incident, Mr. Saikali said. “The story here that the plaintiffs will tell is that Google knew something here and hid it. That by itself is enough to make the lawyers salivate,” he said.

In its contracts with paid users of G Suite apps, Google tells customers it will notify them about any incidents involving their data “promptly and without undue delay” and will “promptly take reasonable steps to minimize harm.” That requirement may not apply to Google+ profile data, however, even if it belonged to a G Suite customer."

The Google Cloud Platform is a set of cloud computing services that includes online management tools to manage data storage, data analytics and other services. (Photo by Adam Berry/Getty Images) (Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google has decided not to compete for the Pentagon’s cloud-computing contract valued at as much as $10 billion, saying the project may conflict with its corporate values.

The project, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure cloud, or JEDI, involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Companies are due to submit bids for the contract, which could last as long as 10 years, on October 12th.

Google’s announcement on Monday came just months after the company decided not to renew its contract with a Pentagon artificial intelligence program, after extensive protests from employees of the internet giant about working with the military. The company then released a set of principles designed to evaluate what kind of artificial intelligence projects it would pursue.

“We are not bidding on the JEDI contract because first, we couldn’t be assured that it would align with our AI Principles,"" a Google spokesman said in a statement. ""And second, we determined that there were portions of the contract that were out of scope with our current government certifications.”

The spokesman added that Google is “working to support the U.S. government with our cloud in many ways.”

Google is behind other technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in obtaining government cloud-security authorizations that depend on the sensitivity of data a service is hosting.

The JEDI contract attracted widespread interest from technology companies struggling to catch up with Amazon in the burgeoning federal government market for cloud services. Final requirements for the project were released in July after a months-long lobbying campaign in Washington by tech companies including Microsoft, International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. that opposed the Pentagon’s plans to choose just one winner for the project instead of splitting the contract among a number of providers.

“Had the JEDI contract been open to multiple vendors, we would have submitted a compelling solution for portions of it,” the Google spokesman said. “Google Cloud believes that a multi-cloud approach is in the best interest of government agencies, because it allows them to choose the right cloud for the right workload.”

In a report to Congress, the Defense Department said making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that “could prevent DoD from rapidly delivering new capabilities and improved effectiveness to the warfighter that enterprise-level cloud computing can enable.”

The department also said it expects “to maintain contracts with numerous cloud providers to access specialized capabilities not available under the JEDI Cloud contract.”

To activate the feature, click the ""CC"" button in the navigation box when you start presenting. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, which are command + Shift + c on Mac and Ctrl + Shift + c in Chrome OS/Windows.

The feature works for a single user speaking in US English, and is only available on the Chrome browser on a laptop or desktop. Google says it wants to roll out the feature in more countries and languages in the future.

Laura D'Aquila and Abigail Klein, software engineers on the G Suite accessibility team, began working on the feature as part of an internal hackathon. D'Aquila, who has hearing loss, and Klein found it can be tough for people who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow along with presentations.

Google has developed other tools over the years designed to help people with disabilities. Last week, it launched its Voice Access app, which lets users navigate Android phones hands-free. In May, it said it was developing an Android app called Lookout, which would help the visually impaired by giving spoken clues about the objects, text and people around them.

101,The many annoying ways Google forced users onto Google+,MSN Money,2018-10-09,0.990644,0.786176,"In 2013, YouTube announced that users would be required to use their Google+ account in order to leave comments on the platform. The new sign-up screen didn’t provide a “skip Google+” option, so the only way to make a Google account without a Google+ profile was to close the browser tab midway through the sign-up process, then open up another Google page and log in. “Making it quick and easy to create a Google Account and a Google profile enables new users to take advantage of everything Google can offer,” a company rep told Ars Technica in 2012. So, if you were logged into your Google+ account while using it, then photos and posts from a user’s account and the people in their Circles would be injected into the results. Anything a Google+ user was invited to populated to their Google+ Events page and was added to their calendar.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/the-many-annoying-ways-google-forced-users-onto-googleplus/ar-BBO9m8W?srcref=rss,"Yesterday, Google announced plans to shut down the consumer version of Google+ after a previously undisclosed security flaw was brought to light. Launched in June 2011, Google+ was Google’s most ambitious attempt at creating a social networking platform. It rapidly gained millions of users, but as usage slowed, Google wedged Google+ into countless services, pushing people to join and use the network — whether they wanted to or not.

It never quite took off, and in 2015, the company said it had plans to drop Google+ as a requirement across its products. Today, even Google admits Google+ has “low usage and engagement” and that 90 percent of Google+ user sessions last less than five seconds. But there was a time when Google desperately wanted to improve that figure by building Google+ into everything it could. Now that the social network is dying, here’s a look back at many of the ways that Google tried to force people to use Google+.

This is perhaps the most well-known example of forced Google+ use. In 2013, YouTube announced that users would be required to use their Google+ account in order to leave comments on the platform. Going one step further, the comments section would also mirror some details from Google+, like privacy settings and whose posts you might care to see.

In addition, comments posted on a YouTube video would, by default, also be posted to your Google+ profile, unless the option was manually unchecked. People... were not happy. Two years later, in 2015, the company untied Google+ from YouTube, saying, “a Google Account will be all you’ll need to share content, communicate with contacts, create a YouTube channel and more, all across Google.”

In late 2011, Google changed the sign-up process for Gmail, making it nearly impossible to register for a Google account without opening a Google+ profile. The new sign-up screen didn’t provide a “skip Google+” option, so the only way to make a Google account without a Google+ profile was to close the browser tab midway through the sign-up process, then open up another Google page and log in. “Making it quick and easy to create a Google Account and a Google profile enables new users to take advantage of everything Google can offer,” a company rep told Ars Technica in 2012.

Shortly after, it let brands and businesses highlight their Google+ pages and content right in Gmail inboxes. Then, in 2014, Google integrated “Email via Google+” into Gmail, allowing anyone on the social network to send messages to your Gmail inbox. That same year, it decoupled Google+ from Gmail, making Google+ an optional step when creating a Google Account.

Google launched the Google+ Local app in 2012, which integrated reviews and photos from your Google+ friends directly into individual business pages. While it expanded Google’s ability to deliver local business information, it also attempted to push the Google+ platform. Google+ Local as a standalone app was killed just a year later, in 2013, with many of the functions rolled into Google Maps. In 2014, Google tried again by making some public Google+ photos with location information visible in Google Maps.

Google used Google+ to personalize search with an integration called “Search plus Your World” in 2012. The feature lent a social context to search results. So, if you were logged into your Google+ account while using it, then photos and posts from a user’s account and the people in their Circles would be injected into the results. According to Search Engine Land, Google no longer personalizes search results outside of a “user’s location or immediate context from a prior search.”

Google launched Google Play Games in 2013, a service that let people view leaderboards, engage in multiplayer gaming, and unlock achievements. It also required a Google+ profile in order to use it. The Google+ requirement was removed in 2016 as part of “steps to reduce sign-in friction.”

During it’s I/O keynote in 2012, Google announced the addition of a new Google+ feature called Events, which was integrated into Google Calendar. The rollout was rough. Google didn’t provide users with control over what invites appeared on their calendars, which led to immense amounts of spam. Anything a Google+ user was invited to populated to their Google+ Events page and was added to their calendar. Some reported hundreds of events spontaneously appearing on their calendar. Fixes were pushed, but the issues with Event spam automatically adding to calendars persistedforyears in various forms.

In 2011, the Google Bar was a black strip that ran across the top of the screen on all of Google’s web properties. That quickly shifted into a more clean integration with a drop-down menu attached to Google’s logo that let you switch between things like Maps, YouTube, and search. No matter how it looked though, one thing remained the same: it prioritized sharing content with Google+ and came with a notifications icon that let you know whenever there was new activity on your Google+ account.

In 2011, Google+ unveiled Hangouts, a messaging app that allowed for group text and video chats. It required a Google+ account in order to sign up. Google+ Hangouts were integrated into Gmail in 2012, but just two years later, Hangouts was untethered from Google+, letting anyone with a Google Apps account use the service. “Google Apps customers have been taking advantage of both Google+ and Hangouts for long enough that we recognize the separate use cases for both,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch at the time.

Google+ Photos shut down in 2015 when it was replaced by spin-off product Google Photos. Photos could still be sent to Google+, but it was no longer seen as core to the service. And, having Google Photos exist on its own made the Google+ version redundant. “The reality is that maintaining both Google+ Photos (the private photo management component of Google+) and Google Photos poses several challenges,” said Anil Sabharwal, director of Google Photos in 2015. “Most notably, it is confusing to users why we have two offerings that virtually do the same thing.”"

With the Pixel line, Google takes ""pure"" Android and makes subtle tweaks, mostly to the launcher, to provide a more Pixel-like experience. Instead of having to deal with duplicate apps as is the case on Samsung devices, a Pixel comes with Google services and apps, and nothing more. With that ownership, Google is able to reliably push out monthly security updates directly to all Pixel devices, regardless of wireless carrier.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/pixel-3-vs-iphone-xs-or-galaxy-note-9-5-reasons-to-go-with-googles-phone/ar-BBOaljv?srcref=rss,"Google just unveiled its next-generation flagship smartphones, the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL.

The new phones include wireless charging-- a first for Pixel devices -- along with larger displays. Camera improvements thanks to AI are found throughout the entire photography experience on the Pixel 3. And, of course, Google is using AI to do other fancy things like screen incoming calls and provide a transcript on the screen in real time.

Below are 5 reasons you should pick upcoming Google's Pixel phone over Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy lineup.

Should you decide to go with a Pixel, you can pre-order the phone right now.

With each new smartphone cycle, the camera is one area that's improved nearly across the board. Sometimes it's smaller tweaks like with Samsung's line of Galaxy phones, other times there are big steps forward as is the case with the iPhone XS.

In just two short years Google has produced what's arguably the best smartphone camera on the market -- and it's done it by using one camera, not two as is the case with its competitors.

One word comes to mind when I think of the Pixel's camera: Reliable. Its ability to consistently snap a high-quality photo is something I appreciate immensely.



Since the launch of the original Pixel phone, Google has provided Pixel users with unlimited photo and video (at original quality) back up through its Google Photos service for free. Google Photos offers free unlimited backup for optimized versions of your videos and photos to everyone else, but Google allows users to back up and store the original, full-quality, versions of his or her photo library.

It's an easy decision when your choices are to pay for more iCloud or have Google Photos upload lower-quality photos for free on a Galaxy device.

A lot of fuss has been made about Android and the customization that companies like Samsung make to it. With the Pixel line, Google takes ""pure"" Android and makes subtle tweaks, mostly to the launcher, to provide a more Pixel-like experience.

Instead of having to deal with duplicate apps as is the case on Samsung devices, a Pixel comes with Google services and apps, and nothing more.

As for the iPhone, let's face it, not everyone is a fan of iOS and it's limitations.

One thing Google has over all of its Android partners is control over the operating system. With that ownership, Google is able to reliably push out monthly security updates directly to all Pixel devices, regardless of wireless carrier. Instead of waiting for Samsung to implement an update, and attempt to time it with bug and feature updates, and then wait for the carrier to push it out, Pixel updates are simultaneous.

Admittedly, Apple has the same approach, although updates aren't always released monthly. Updates for the iPhone are released when needed, as slow or fast as required.

Apple and Samsung each sell a phone that costs over $1,000. Google is close to that price tag, but just barely. The Pixel 3 is priced at $799 and $899 for 64GB or 128GB of storage, respectively. The Pixel 3 XL starts at $899 and tops out at $999 for the same amount of storage."
103,Selling Amazon stock is Suze Orman's top money regret,MSN Money,2018-10-10,0.636974,0.997225,"Looking back on the past few decades, Suze Orman has one major money-related regret: Buying about $5,000 worth of Amazon stock in 1997 — and selling it just a few years later.

She sold those shares when the company started taking off and, although she estimates that she quadrupled her money at the time, her shares would be worth millions today.

Although Orman chose to put money in Amazon, she doesn't generally recommend investing in individual companies or trying to play the market.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/selling-amazon-stock-is-suze-ormans-top-money-regret/ar-BBObWQ9?srcref=rss,"Looking back on the past few decades, Suze Orman has one major money-related regret: Buying about $5,000 worth of Amazon stock in 1997 — and selling it just a few years later.

""If I had kept the number of shares that I had originally purchased for Amazon, oh my God, I can't even imagine what that would be worth today,"" the personal finance expert and best-selling author of ""Women & Money"" tells CNBC Make It. ""It makes me sick to even tabulate it.""

Orman first purchased shares of Amazon because she liked the branding. ""I thought it was such a cool name for a stock,"" she says. ""I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon.""

She sold those shares when the company started taking off and, although she estimates that she quadrupled her money at the time, her shares would be worth millions today.

A $1,000 investment made at the time of Amazon's IPO in May 1997 would be worth around $1.2 million as of October 9, according to CNBC calculations. If Orman had invested her $5,000 around the same time and kept them, her shares would be worth more than $6 million.

When she sold, Orman recalls, she felt great. Now, ""I get sick to my stomach when I think about what it would be worth,"" she says. But, she says, she can't complain too much about her losses: ""I bought it back years later and still own it to this day.""

Although Orman chose to put money in Amazon, she doesn't generally recommend investing in individual companies or trying to play the market. Investing is always risky and, even if you do take the risk, you should do lots of your own research before buying.

If you do buy, though, make sure to hold, she says: ""When you have a good stock, it doesn't matter if it goes from 10 to 20 to 40, you keep it for the long run.""

""Look at your Googles, look at your Facebooks, look at all of those things, are you kidding me?"" she adds. ""You keep a great stock forever.""

The method of ""buy and hold"" is also endorsed by legendary investors Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle. Buffett looks for businesses that will continue to have a competitive advantage decades down the line. ""Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year,"" he said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years.""

A business is worth investing in, Buffett believes, because it will last, not because it's doing well right now. ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes,"" he wrote in his 1996 letter to shareholders.

Likewise, regardless of the economic climate, investors should stay steady and focused on the future, Bogle, founder of The Vanguard Group, said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"": ""Don't let these changes in the market, even the big one [like the financial crisis] … change your mind, and never, never, never be in or out of the market. Always be in at a certain level.""

Bogle specifically recommends putting money in index funds, such as the S&P 500, which automatically invest you in a diverse array of companies. ""If you hold the stock market, you will grow with America,"" he said.

If you try to trade in and out of the market, ""your emotions will defeat you totally,"" Bogle added. ""Short-term betting is not a good way to go.""

As a safer alternative to picking individual stocks, Orman also recommends low-risk investing options, such as index funds and ETFs. She also suggests a strategy known as ""dollar cost averaging,"" in which you invest a fixed amount into the stock market on a regular basis instead of buying a lump sum of stock all at once.

When share prices are high, you're able to buy less, but when prices drop, you can buy more, and it all levels out in the end. ""Over time, your dollars — the cost of those shares — are averaged so that you always come out ahead,"" Orman says."

106,3 strategies for companies concerned about Amazon wage hike,MSN Money,2018-10-11,0.846103,0.591123,"Amazon’s plans to pay employees at least $15 an hour is putting pressure on small business owners, even those that aren’t retailers who directly compete with the huge company.

Amazon’s plans to pay employees at least $15 an hour is putting pressure on small business owners, even those that aren’t retailers who directly compete with the huge company. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, File) NEW YORK — Amazon's plans to pay all its U.S. employees at least $15 an hour is putting pressure on small business owners, even those who aren't retailers directly competing with the huge company.

""Amazon is giving a kick in the butt to a lot of business owners to increase compensation,"" says Gene Marks, owner of The Marks Group, a small business consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.

Small businesses located near Amazon's dozens of order fulfillment centers vie with the company for staffers, and the competition will become even fiercer during the upcoming holiday season, when Amazon needs an extra 100,000 people to pack and ship boxes.

Amazon is ""doing what they need to do to get employees,"" Marks says.

The company, whose market value briefly topped $1 trillion last month, has another motive — placating critics including some politicians who have called on Amazon to give its employees a raise.

The strong economy and shrinking labor pool has made workers hard to find for employers of all kinds, including big retail chains, fast-food restaurants and small businesses. Some are boosting pay. But higher wages are harder for small businesses to absorb because they don't have the massive revenue stream of a company like Amazon.

Meanwhile, small retailers who sell on Amazon expect the internet giant to increase the fees it charges them to help fund the salary increases. But small business consultants, and owners themselves, say strategizing can help lessen the pain.

Here are three things small business owners need to know about Amazon's wage hike:

A small business can be more flexible than a huge company. So, while small businesses may not be able to match Amazon's pay, they can sweeten the pot for potential hires and their current employees in other ways.

Owners should say to prospective employees, ""we may have a little difficulty giving you the full $15, but what else can we do for you,"" says Brent Leary, co-founder of CRM Essentials, a consulting firm.

With fewer workers to juggle, small businesses can more easily offer flexible schedules, transportation or other perks that might make up for slightly lower pay. And companies that employ people in their 20s and 30s find that many of their staffers would prefer more benefits to extra pay.

Small businesses can also be better at giving younger people training and mentoring, even during a short-term hire.

""If you provide a work experience that they're looking for, that makes it easier to find people,"" Leary says.

RAISING PRICES MAY NOT SCARE CUSTOMERS AWAY

Some small business owners may have to pass along the higher costs of competing with Amazon or selling through its website to their customers. Many owners dread having to charge more but they should realize that consumers and businesses are likely to be more accepting of higher prices now that the economy is strong, Marks says.

Moreover, ""if you have to increase your prices, your competition probably has to also,"" Marks says.

Companies that have to raise prices should be up-front with customers about why it's happening, Leary says. That will help preserve a good relationship with their customers.

Amazon stokes goodwill of its own by offering customers same-day or even one-hour delivery. Still, retailers have the ability to differentiate themselves, says John Lawson, an online marketing consultant.

""Amazon doesn't necessarily have the most personalized service,"" he says.

Lawson finds that more consumers are interested in ordering online and picking up merchandise in stores; any brick-and-mortar retailer that can offer that service should, he says.

GoVacuum.com, which sells on Amazon as well as its own website, believes the fees it pays the company for taking orders and packing and shipping merchandise will go up as a result of the higher wages. But GoVacuum.com Vice President Justin Haver says the increase is a cost of doing business, and a change the Chantilly, Virginia, company will take in stride.

""The reality is, selling online and running a business requires forward thinking and nimble adaptation to current trends/opportunities,"" Haver says.

Many owners may look for cost savings elsewhere in their company, perhaps finding cheaper supplies or lower shipping costs.

But Lawson, whose company sells vacuum cleaners and parts, notes that it costs money to sell merchandise, no matter what retail channel or what distribution and delivery system a business owner uses.

""After all these years, you just kind of get used to it. If it's not Amazon, it's the U.S. Postal Service,"" says Lawson, who has been an online seller. ""Every year it gets more and more expensive to stay in business and ultimately the consumer pays more.""

Koh, CEO of Samsung's mobile business, said you'll be able to use the device as a tablet with multitasking capability before being able to fold it up into a more portable phone.

""When we deliver a foldable phone, it has to be really meaningful to our customer,"" Koh said in an interview at the sidelines of the Samsung Galaxy A9 launch. ""If the user experience is not up to my standard, I don't want to deliver those kind of products.""

He once again stressed the foldable phone wouldn't be a ""gimmick product"" that will ""disappear after six to nine months after it's delivered."" It'll also be available globally, unlike previous phones like the Galaxy Round, which used a curved display and was available only in Korea.

Samsung has been chasing the holy grail of a foldable phone since it teased one at CES 2013 by showing off a flexible OLED display. Koh confirmed last month that Samsung's upcoming device will be launched this year and could debut as early as next month at Samsung's Developer Conference. The folding capability would mark a major advance in smartphones, which have stagnated with fewer innovations.

Samsung isn't the only company aiming at a foldable phone. Huawei could be gunning to be the first to launch such a device, in November. Huawei  beat Apple to become the world's second-largest smartphone maker, and is likely aiming for Samsung's top spot. Launching the first foldable phone could help either company cement a reputation as a trailblazer and create buzz that could trickle down to its more traditional, and cheaper, phones.

The larger screen is important, Koh said. When Samsung first released the original Galaxy Note, he said, competitors called its device dead on arrival. Now, after generations of Notes phones, you see larger devices like the iPhone XS Max and the Pixel 3 XL, proving that consumers want bigger screens. A foldable phone would let screen sizes extend beyond 6.5 inches.

""Possibly when we start selling the foldable phone, it may be a niche market, but definitely, it will expand,"" Koh said. ""I'm positive that we do need a foldable phone."""

On Wednesday, the USPS suggested raising the price of sending a small flat-rate box to $7.90 from $7.20; increasing a medium flat-rate box to $14.35 from $13.65; and charging $19.95 to send a large flat-rate box, up from $18.90.

“Our math . . . suggests Amazon will have 5% lower retail operating income from this shipping cost inflation, if we assume there are no offsetting factors,” Barclays said.

The changes would go into effect on Jan. 27, 2019.

“Specifically, the USPS shipping rates for small and medium boxes, typically used by e-commerce companies, are proposed to be increased by 10% and 5% respectively,” Barclays analysts led by Ross Sandler wrote. “[T]he price increases for packages suggested by USPS this year are higher than in prior years.”

“If other Amazon shipping partners like UPS , FedEx , On-Trac, etc. raise their prices, which has happened in the past (but we are currently not factoring in), every 5% hike for last mile would weigh down operating income by an additional 3%, all else constant,” the note said.



President Trump said the USPS is Amazon’s  “delivery boy” in a tweet earlier this year, and blamed the e-commerce giant for its billion-dollar-plus losses in the second fiscal quarter.

However, the USPS said it’s actually government policy that’s hurting the group’s finances. The USPS said “legislative and regulatory changes” would be necessary for financial stability.

“To be clear, our current estimates already factor in [a] shipping cost increase by a modest level, consistent with prior years,” Barclays said. “However, the steeper increase proposed for 2019 could weigh further on Amazon’s FY19 profitability.”

In a separate note, Barclays forecast that Amazon shares could take a hit after third-quarter earnings if they are in line with guidance and forecast below expectations. And in the fourth-quarter, the $15 minimum wage hike will add about $310 million to expenses.

Barclays analysts think the minimum wage hike is just one of a few coming initiatives that could impact operating margin expansion.

Besides that, two of the Pixel 3's camera features (Night Sight and Top Shot) won't be ready until after the phones go on sale.",http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/google-thinks-the-pixel-3s-1-rear-camera-will-beat-samsungs-4/ar-BBOjAvM?srcref=rss,"The Pixel 3's lone rear camera makes a brazen statement to any phone with two rear cameras or more: ""Google's single lens is better than all your fancy cameras combined.""

Those are fighting words in a landscape where a dual-camera setup is now so coveted, even budget phones like the Moto G6 have two lenses for portrait photos. With the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, Google is now the only major phone-maker whose most high-end device has just one rear camera. Case in point: The iPhone XS has two, the Huawei P20 Pro and LG V40 boast three, and Samsung's new Galaxy A9 has a jaw-dropping four cameras on its back.

Cameras are a big deal. Along with battery life, photography is one of the main reasons why people choose one phone over another. Photos with the most vibrant colors, deepest contrast, sharpest edges and brightest low-light shots can win the day. Extra features like portrait photos, dramatic lighting options, wide-angle selfies and automatic, AI-driven scene detection can help phones stand out from one another -- or keep phone-makers from falling further behind their competitors.

There are a few reasons phones have a second, or even third, rear lens. Many phones have a telephoto sensor, which can add depth for portrait photos and give you a better image when you zoom in. An additional monochrome sensor can take black-and-white photos without applying a filter, or be used to add details that enhance a color picture. The triple-lens Huawei P20 Pro has all three.

The LG V40's three rear cameras can simultaneously snap a photo from each lens, and you can pick your favorite. That's more a software gimmick than an actual benefit. And the rumored Galaxy A9 is said to have an ultrawide lens in addition to a ""depth camera,"" a telephoto lens and the 24-megapixel ""main"" sensor.

Google's willingness to bet the farm on its cycloptic lens is a play of confidence in the company's hardware quality and software strength. It only ""needs"" one camera, the Pixel 3 suggests, because Google's process is better. The tech titan, with its seemingly limitless resources, is far ahead of phone-makers when it comes to advanced image processing.

Specifically, AI and machine learning are two cutting-edge efforts in helping computers make decisions on their own, for example brightening a photo based on dark weather conditions. And Google says it's studied millions of photos on Google Images to rethink ""how images are captured,"" Google hardware SVP Rick Osterloh said in Tuesday's presentation.

Google has also outfitted its Pixel 3 phones with extra or enhanced camera modes. Super Res Zoom creates a zoomed-in shot from multiple photos. Portrait mode lets you fine-tune the focus point, depth of field and color saturation. And low-light photos promise to be even brighter and better than the Pixel 2's already lauded low-light capabilities, without you ever turning on the flash -- a feature Google dubs Night Sight. Top Shot picks your best photo for you when you have motion mode on.

Given Google's extraordinary confidence in its single rear camera, it's interesting that the Pixel 3 phones follow handsets like LG's V40 to add a second camera on the face.

Last year's single-lens Pixel 2 was one of the only phones I used in 2017 that accurately kept my curly hair in focus on a portrait mode shot. Google accomplished that feat with software alone, so why is a second lens necessary now?

Google says that the wide-angle selfie cam, which it claims is 184 percent wider than the iPhone XS' front-facing shooter, is designed to fit more of your friends (or your landscape) into the frame. We managed to fit 13 CNET editors into a selfie shot on the Pixel 3, so it's off to a good start.

The question on my mind -- and everyone else's -- is how well Google's Pixel phones will succeed. Is the single camera really better than two or more? And which meaningful tricks and tools will the Pixel phones miss out on that other phones have?

Unfortunately, we have to wait. CNET's Pixel 3 reviews are ongoing, and those camera comparison deep dives you love take time. Besides that, two of the Pixel 3's camera features (Night Sight and Top Shot) won't be ready until after the phones go on sale.

Until then, I'll leave you with the reminder that Google's Pixel phones have an excellent photography track record. In fact, I can't think of a single mainstream phone playing at this high-end level that doesn't take terrific pictures overall.

In other words, if you're drawn to the Pixel 3 for its relatively lower price, timely Android updates and unlimited storage on Google Photos, it's a safe bet that its photos will be good, even great. If you're looking for professional-grade photography and want to be completely sure, hold off ordering while we work on competitor comparisons.

By market cap , it trails Apple. Measured by number of employees, it's behind Walmart. By revenues, it's a distant eighth on the Fortune 500 list. But measured by importance to modern life and ability to shape the American economy in its own image, Amazon is second to none.

Part of Amazon's remarkable influence stems from the sheer variety of its business lines and the way it touches our everyday lives. Born in 1994 as a modest online bookseller, Amazon has grown organically and by accretion into an internet giant that plays in nearly every sector, from producing movies to transporting freight.

It has a full suite of electronic devices, including a digital assistant that thousands of consumers rely on to perform daily tasks (Alexa), an electronic reader (Kindle) and a home security system (Ring). Its server business hosts a third of the world's cloud-based data. After deflating brick-and-mortar retail, it's become a brick-and-mortar retailer itself with its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, its physical bookstores, and its foray into cashierless convenience stores. Now, it's trying to become the place where you can find a handyman and fill your prescriptions, maybe even buy home insurance and get a loan.

All of that growth has helped make the man behind Amazon, CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, with a net worth of $160.2 billion, according to Forbes — although that goes up or down with the company's stock price each day.

Welcome to the United States of Amazon.

In the upcoming weeks, CNN Business will examine the many ways Amazon has permeated the American economy — from the benefits it brings to the risks its vast influence poses.

After all, most consumers delight in the ability to get the world delivered to their doorstep in as little as two days (with 5% cash back on an Amazon credit card to boot). The Prime membership is the price of admission to a new level of convenience, cost savings and choice, from discounts in the grocery aisle to instant access to award-winning movies and television shows.

""The number one thing that has made us successful, by far, is obsessive-compulsive focus on the customer as opposed to obsession over the competitor,"" said Bezos, at an Economic Club of Washington dinner in September.

But there's a downside when one company has that much leverage. The company's enormous workforce and economic influence mean it has the power to squeeze wages and even warp the political process, as evidenced by the billions of dollars in tax breaks Amazon has already received for its fulfillment centers and the goodies currently in the offing for its second headquarters.

Large, diversified holding companies are nothing new. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, India's Tata Group and South Korea's Samsung touch on many parts of the global economy.

But Amazon is different. It strategically connects and leverages enough information about your behaviors in one part of your life to make predictions about what you might need in another. By doing so, it captures more of your disposable income across industries.

""They were, from the start, not really in the books business,"" says Daniel Raff, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""They understood that the web site was a source of information for them about who their customers were, and their customers' search behavior and price sensitivity.""

That last perk is what has set Amazon apart from the e-commerce competition. Raff compares Amazon to a mid-20th century Sears Roebuck, the catalog company that shipped a universe of consumer goods from the center of America's rail network in Chicago to anyone within reach of a mail truck. But rather than aggregating through a central hub, Amazon has built its own distributed empire of warehouses. Staffed by armies of workers and, more recently, robots, this network allows the company to deliver packages nearly as quickly as a shopper clicks ""Buy.""

Amazon's aggressive investment in its fulfillment network is just one way in which the company has enjoyed the full confidence of Wall Street while never paying a dividend to shareholders.

The company only started booking profits consistently in 2015, boosted by cloud computing — that is, Amazon Web Services, a data hosting business that generated $6 billion in revenue last quarter.

As much as Amazon has created a wonderland of options for consumers, its increasing dominance poses a challenge for those who have a product to sell. Sellers can scarcely afford not to have a presence on the site. But selling through Amazon can mean giving away control over pricing, as well as paying for advertising, for expedited help with any problems and for shipping and returns for customers who complain for any reason.

""It's a pay-to-play model,"" says Troy Johnston, a former Amazon seller who now provides software to help other sellers optimize their performance on the site. ""They find ways to add in a fee for every bit of access.""

As a result, sellers gain exposure to an enormous audience and higher sales. But they lose some of their ability to maintain their profit margins, putting downward pressure on wages and driving less-efficient companies out of business entirely.

In terms of the economics, which is concerned more with aggregate welfare than equity or fairness to certain individuals, that's not necessarily a bad thing. But it causes pain for those on the the losing end — especially brick-and-mortar businesses that can't compete with Amazon's fast online deliveries, hard-to-beat prices and near-infinite variety. And having created a portal through which so much commerce must flow, Amazon enriches itself by charging a toll along the way.

In a way, Amazon is doing the same thing in its search for a location for its new headquarters. It's treating prospective host cities as if they were sellers on Amazon, drawing them into a bidding war. Those cities are offering up tax breaks and subsidies, even if doing so jeopardizes their future tax revenue and drives up the price of housing for everyone else.

How big is too big?

Ultimately, government regulators may be the only force that can check Amazon's growth.

""Will Amazon get to a point where antitrust officials get nervous? Absolutely,"" says Jim Cortada, a senior research fellow at the Center for the History of Information Technology at the University of Minnesota.

Despite a long-term shift in the United States' competition policy toward tolerating big companies as long as they benefit ""consumer welfare,"" Cortada notes that European regulators have taken a dimmer view of emerging US tech giants. Any case against Amazon, he said, would have worldwide implications.

When asked about the prospect of regulators deciding to put a damper on Amazon's growth, Bezos typically says he's not concerned.

""All big institutions of any kind are going to be and should be examined, scrutinized, inspected. It's what we as a society want to have happen,"" he said at an Economic Club of Washington dinner in September. ""Whatever regulations are promulgated, that will not stop us from serving customers. Under all regulatory frameworks I can imagine, customers are still going to want low prices, they're still going to want fast delivery, they're still going to want big selection.""

As its hotly-contested and widely-publicized search for a second headquarters draws to a close, CNN Business is taking a top-to-bottom look at Amazon's present — and what it means to our future in its series, The United States of Amazon."

112,All the ways Amazon's AI brought me the socks I am wearing right now,CNN,2018-10-05,0.495774,0.840769,"""Amazon probably uses AI more extensively than any other company in the world today,"" Pedro Domingos, a University of Washington professor and author of The Master Algorithm, told CNN Business.

Amazon has started delivering some of its own packages, and it's no surprise what makes this possible: Artificial intelligence creates the routes drivers take, and estimates delivery times, with the help of weather data, traffic patterns and several other proprietary data points Amazon won't reveal.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/viIYU-jI8kg/index.html,"Seattle (CNN Business) My socks arrived at my home in Washington, DC, as so many things do these days, in a brown box sealed with Amazon Prime tape. I ripped it open and pulled out the cotton athletic socks I'd ordered just two days before for $19.65. Big deal, you may think. You bought socks on Amazon . That's news?

No, it isn't. What's newsworthy is just how much artificial intelligence went into selecting those socks, completing the order and delivering them. You've probably never given it much thought, but AI drives almost every aspect of your shopping experience. Amazon's dominance in online retail is due in no small part to its mastery of artificial intelligence: the ability of machines to do work that was once the purview of humans alone.

""Amazon probably uses AI more extensively than any other company in the world today,"" Pedro Domingos, a University of Washington professor and author of The Master Algorithm, told CNN Business. ""Amazon is a company that wants to do everything, and in AI it has found a technology that is good for everything.""

Artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize everything from health care to farming, but we need not look to tomorrow to see its impact. The technology already underpins so many aspects of everyday life that we don't give a second thought to: email spam filters and mobile check depositing apps, not to mention advanced automotive safety features like Cadillac's Super Cruise and aircraft autopilot systems.

Delivery companies like FedEx and UPS rely upon artificial intelligence to plan routes and chat with customers. Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous vehicle tech wouldn't work without AI. And Netflix ( NFLX ) uses it to suggest shows you may like.

But no one uses AI quite like Amazon, where thousands of engineers work on it.

""It's hard to imagine today's Amazon without AI,"" said Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. ""An impressive, and growing, part of Amazon's competitive edge is due to their sophisticated AI systems.""

Amazon recently invited CNN Business to its headquarters in Seattle to get a glimpse of the AI that brought those socks to my door. The company wouldn't reveal all of its secrets, some of which are proprietary technology, but it shared enough to get an overview of the AI behind every purchase.

The AI kicks in the moment I hit return after typing ""Amazon.com"" into my Web browser. Amazon's homepage includes product recommendations that artificial intelligence curates given my history on the site -- in this case dog treats and a Joni Mitchell album inspired by recent purchases for my golden retriever and my father.

I don't need chicken jerky tenders or a copy of The Hissing of Summer Laws, so I click the search bar. I get no further than typing ""s"" and Amazon's AI is already offering suggestions. SD card. Spiderman PS4. Shower curtain. To hone this suggestion list, Amazon taps historical data from billions of searches, and the results evolve constantly to reflect how people who start a query with ""s"" typically complete it. Queries that have been most likely to lead to a sale top the list.

I choose ""socks"" from the dropdown menu, triggering several more AI systems compile the results. The algorithms list the options in an order designed to promote a quick, and satisfying, purchase. Products with the greatest number of sales and positive reviews tend to appear first.

""Every conceivable optimization opportunity has some form of machine learning applied to it,"" said Srikanth Thirumalai, who leads search at Amazon. He's worked at Amazon since 2005, and since day one has been centered on using artificial intelligence techniques to make products more discoverable, and shopping more pleasant. His very first project was identifying duplicate product pages.

Amazon sells a dizzying variety of socks. In fact, the query ""men's socks"" returns more than 70,000 results. No one could possibly scroll through them all, especially while staring at a smartphone. It's critical that Amazon shows customers what they truly want.

Amazon's AI decides which socks to show me, and how high they should be placed on the page. It crunches sales data -- Amazon won't say how much -- to determine which socks sell best. Those listings feature the orange ""best seller"" tag. (Sponsored items, in which merchants buy preferential placement on the results page, override the AI results.)

When I click on some Puma socks that catch my eye, Amazon sends me to the product page. Here Amazon's AI suggests other products I may be interested in, including Puma socks in a different color and Hanes boxers other customers have bought with their Puma socks.

Once I add the socks to my shopping car and click ""buy,"" I won't think about them again until they land on my porch. But that's when a whole new set of AI processes steps in.

First, Amazon uses AI to choose a fulfillment center to process my order. Several of these centers are within 140 miles of me, but Amazon may not use the one closest to my home in Washington, D.C. The company would not reveal how it selects a fulfillment center, but logistics experts said the choice probably reflects inventory (which is based, in part, on AI predictions on seasonal trends), shipping costs and how busy each center is.

In this case, Amazon's AI did choose the center closest to me, in Baltimore, just 40 miles or so up the road. Before I bought them, my socks were sitting on a storage pod -- which looks a bit like a four-sided bookcase about 6.5 feet tall. Once I clicked ""buy"" and placed my order, another AI system decided which warehouse robot would retrieve it from the pod and bring it to a human being. Proximity is only one factor the AI takes into account; the algorithms also considers how quickly a robot can reach an Amazon employee and how busy each employee is.

Once dispatched, the robot slides under the storage pod, lifts it a couple inches, and scoots off to join the queue alongside an associate's workstation. It might seem a whole lot easier, and cheaper, to have a staffer fetch my socks from the pod -- but Amazon says bringing items to associates is far more efficient. AI lets Amazon maintain a balanced workload at each workstation while keeping the robots moving smoothly and quickly.

Until recently, an associate might reach into a bin to find nothing there. Artificial intelligence ensures my socks, or your whatever, are in the proper pod. Amazon calls its visual bin inspection, a technique it revealed for the first time to CNN Business.

Once an associate takes a product from a storage pod, a robot carts the pod to a holding area. Along the way, a camera snaps a photo of the pod and its contents. Computer vision software reviews the image; if anything looks amiss, the robot brings the pod to an inspection area, where a human checks the pod's inventory and makes any needed corrections.

An associate tossed my socks into a yellow crate, which then zipped through the warehouse on a conveyor belt to another workstation, where associates consolidate orders. If I'd selected the Nike tennis shoes Amazon's AI had suggested, this is where someone would place them into a box with my socks. Once packaged, orders land on another conveyor belt and past a robot arm that slaps the mailing label on the parcel. AI then decides what to do next.

""Which door is it going out of the fulfillment center?"" said Brad Porter, vice president of robotics at Amazon. ""Which truck is it going to go out on?"" Algorithms consider where the package is going, which other orders are going to the same general area and how quickly they must arrive at their destination. Artificial intelligence chooses the most efficient route for every order, no matter how small.

Amazon has started delivering some of its own packages, and it's no surprise what makes this possible: Artificial intelligence creates the routes drivers take, and estimates delivery times, with the help of weather data, traffic patterns and several other proprietary data points Amazon won't reveal. Rainy day? Your delivery may be slower. Heavy traffic? Drivers may be directed on an atypical route. And Amazon increasingly offers one-hour delivery times in some cities, which requires near perfect delivery routes.

Even after your package hits your doorstep, AI has one more job to do. The Amazon driver snaps a picture of your package and emails it to you so you know it arrived. The company trained an AI to recognize that it really is your package in the photo, and ensures the photo is framed in such a way to ensure you know exactly where to find your package.

Pretty smart. You could even call it intelligent."

It looks like any of the thousands of dog food choices on the site. But the ordinary packaging and description mask a significant development. That brand is called Wag, and it's made by Amazon itself.

With its launch in May, Amazon charged into the pet food market.

After mastering how to sell everyone else's stuff, Amazon has sharpened its focus. Now it's trying to persuade shoppers to buy its own products.

It's succeeding. Amazon's private label sales will reach $7.5 billion this year, analysts at SunTrust Robinson estimate. By 2022, they are expected to hit $25 billion.

The shift has enormous implications not just for Amazon's customers, but for its brand partners.

Last week, Amazon rolled out an AmazonBasics memory foam mattress.

Some of the brands Amazon produces carry its name, such as AmazonBasics or Amazon Essentials, but most sound like they were pumped out of a generic brand engine: True Angel sweaters, Indigo Society jeans, Crafted Collar button-downs.

Amazon closely guards its sales data, but the company told CNN Business that its private label growth was ""notable"" in categories such as paper products, diapers, coffee pods, and vitamins and supplements.

Batteries, lightning and computer cables, paper shredders, office chairs, light bulbs, and pet crates are some of its top-selling AmazonBasics products.

Despite the increasing prominence of private labels, the company has stayed quiet about its plans. In March, however, David Fildes, Amazon's director of investor relations, offered clues to a broader strategy.

Amazon's private label products were designed to ""supplement"" the choices customers can find on the site from name brands, he told analysts. ""We look for ways to be able to find private label items that have a high caliber of quality, but also can bring that selection and that convenience for customers.""

""We'll keep adding selection,"" he said.

But as the company muscles into new industries and becomes more aggressive promoting its own products, established manufacturers are growing concerned: Is Amazon a neutral platform to sell products through, or a threat to business?

Amazon says outside brands are still the best sellers across its site.

Damon Jones, a vice president at Procter & Gamble, is confident that P&G will still be a leader in product innovation and growth, despite Amazon's private label expansion. P&G makes Tide, Bounty, Charmin and Pampers, among many other well-known brands.

But Jones acknowledged that ""it does up the ante for us to ensure our products are noticeably superior.""

Over the past two years, Amazon has invested heavily in men's and women's fashion lines, adding dozens of brands.

Bolstered by these new labels, Amazon will soon hit a milestone: The company will overtake Walmart this year as the largest clothing seller in the United States, according to Morgan Stanley.

Amazon is wading into fashion in part because many brands like Ralph Lauren, wary of ceding control over their products or prices, have refused to sell on Amazon.

So Amazon is stepping in with choices of its own: activewear brands like Core 10 and Peak Velocity, Goodthreads casual men's shirts and pants, Paris Sunday dresses and tops for women, and Mae bralettes and panties.

Clothing and shoes represent Amazon's largest private label offering, according to a recent report by retail think tank Coresight Research. Amazon sells close to 5,000 of its own clothing items.

Coresight found that the average private label clothing item on Amazon costs $38, suggesting it is a mid-market seller like Macy's or Kohl's. But Amazon offers a wide range of prices that play all sides of the market.

For example, it offers both a $110 formal dress for women from Social Graces and an $8 sweatshirt for girls under Scout + Ro.

Amazon constantly experiments with its private labels, testing to see what shoppers prefer.

It offers different prices on similar items to gauge customer reaction. Goodthreads' best-selling men's shirts are 60% more expensive on average than Amazon Essentials' shirts.

And as it develops new private label brands, it starts by testing sample products.

Take Amazon's 2017 launch of Mama Bear baby care products. It started by selling diaper pail refills and quickly added Mama Bear diapers and later baby food. In the early months, Amazon offered the products at discounts.

Amazon's next move is usually to sit still and watch. It waits, sometimes for more than a year, and it collects data to understand how products are resonating with shoppers.

When it launched Happy Belly, shoppers were buying far more trail mix than spices — so Amazon soon tripled its assortment for trail mix and nuts, while winding down choices for spices.

Offering store brands was a tried and tested strategy for retailers and grocers long before Amazon came along.

Private label products are usually designed to provide a downmarket alternative for shoppers. They also boost retailers' profit margins because the retailer gets to keep a bigger slice of the sale and spends less on advertising.

And they provide growth: Private label sales grew three times faster last year than national brand products, according to Nielsen.

Beyond these benefits, Amazon is selling its own brands on the site to build customer loyalty.

Amazon brands like Mama Bear baby products are available solely to Prime members. These benefits could be a draw for the more than 100 million Prime subscribers worldwide and alluring to potential recruits.

Amazon may also be moving deeper into private labels to gain leverage over manufacturers that sell on its platform.

Amazon has its own army of products, and limitless space to sell other brands. So it doesn't depend on any one product to lure customers, the way a physical store does. That puts Amazon in a stronger position when it negotiates prices.

""Imagine going into any large store and not finding Tide, Fritos, or Colgate toothpaste on the shelf,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of the grocery retail consulting firm Brick Meets Click.

Although competitors have often targeted their private label efforts to offer generic products at lower prices, Amazon is plotting a different route.

It is focusing its private labels on big trends — natural and organic, sustainability, and environmental-friendliness — Anderson said.

Mama Bear diapers are hypoallergenic and fragrance free. Wickedly Prime foods and drinks highlight ""unusual flavors from around the globe."" And Buttoned Down offers men 72 sizes of dress shirts.

During product development, Amazon, unlike almost all other retailers, has the ability to mine years of product reviews. It benefits from direct feedback from shoppers and knows what they like and dislike about items. That helps the company make decisions about important aspects like design and flavors.

With a stream of second-by-second data on which products shoppers click on or scroll past, and the prices that most effectively propel them to make purchases, ""Amazon has visibility into unmet market needs that most other retailers would struggle to see,"" Anderson added.

Both are important factors that help the company's private labels rank at the top of search pages and get more people to put those products into their virtual carts.

The company noted that AmazonBasics has a 4.28 rating out of 5, and more than a million reviews. Rivet, Stone & Beam, Amazon Elements, Presto!, Happy Belly, Peak Velocity, and Goodthreads are among other brands with a rating above four.

Amazon wants its brands to earn the ""Best Seller"" badge because the ribbon appears atop the products on search pages, giving them an extra lift when shoppers make their purchasing decisions.

""Amazon's Choice,"" an algorithm-determined recommendation, is another distinguishing feature on search pages. Amazon's brands are starting to win the badge.

For example, when a shopper searches for paper towels, a 12-count of Presto! is Amazon's Choice. For batteries, AmazonBasics earns the designation. Same for diapers with Mama Bear. Winning the Amazon's Choice tag also benefits the company's private labels on the Echo and other Alexa products.

On online search pages where Amazon's brands have not become top sellers or won the company's recommendation, Amazon has started to increase sponsored ads and banners for them. That puts it in direct conflict with manufacturers that rely on advertisements on pages to help distinguish themselves.

When searching for dish soap, for example, a banner runs across atop the page with a ""Top Rated from Our Brands"" flag that includes choices for Mountain Falls soap and Amazon Essentials.

""That's the kind of thing that starts to freak out suppliers,"" Anderson said. ""It's a little off-putting to see a ribbon right below what you just paid for that says, 'Look at our products.' Brands are right to be skeptical."""

""We interact with sellers thousands of times a day through a variety of channels and will continue to make sure we maintain that open dialogue,"" a spokesperson from Amazon told CNN Business.",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_latest/~3/If3fE8j6HIo/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN Business) When Nida Kazmi got laid off from her job as a product manager at Bloomberg two years ago, she came up with a fallback plan: Selling stuff on Amazon.

She chose stackable baby formula dispensers because the category didn't seem to have much competition, and found a supplier in China to manufacture them.

After hiring a coach to help her navigate how the world's largest online marketplace works, she set up listings from her home office in Reston, Virginia, selling dispensers for $11.99 a pack. After a few months, the business was doing between $1,500 and $2,000 per month in sales, about half of which she kept as profit.

That's when Kazmi received an email from Amazon's seller support department saying her account had been suspended. Amazon didn't explain why, saying the reason was ""proprietary.""

It took two months of emailed appeals before Amazon reinstated her in November 2017. By that time, she had lost her place in the site's all-important search rankings, and was stuck with 600 stackable baby formula dispensers in her garage. With her source of income gone, she would have to rely on savings while trying to relaunch her sales.

""After all that, I decided I can't continue with this,"" says Kazmi, 34, who decided to start her own social media consulting business instead. ""You plug a lot of your money into buying the inventory up front, you have to. And they can just in a heartbeat turn the switch off.""

Amazon emphasizes the role that micro-enterprises like Kazmi's play in making the website what it is.

""Small businesses and entrepreneurs selling on Amazon Marketplace are incredibly important to our customers,"" Amazon says. ""We work hard to help these businesses successfully reach and delight Amazon customers, and we continue to innovate and improve the experience for all sellers.""

But as many of these sellers quickly learn, Amazon always sets the rules. And in the company's drive to keep customers happy, they can be collateral damage.

""It's just not a place where I felt like 'We're business partners,'"" Kazmi says. ""I felt more like, 'You're God, and I'm nobody.'""

Amazon wasn't the first online platform to enter the business of helping regular people become global merchants. That honor belongs to eBay, which launched in 1995 using auctions to keep buyers hooked on the draw of getting a good deal. Amazon tried auctions, but the business never took off.

Then, Amazon changed the game in two ways.

First, it dispensed with eBay's auction model, allowing shoppers to instead quickly buy items for a fixed price. (Later, eBay followed with its own fixed-price option.) Then Amazon got into the shipping business, developing a vast warehousing and transportation infrastructure that allows sellers to fulfill orders without doing any of the work themselves — something eBay and other e-commerce sites had studiously avoided.

For that reason, thousands of businesses have grown up around Amazon's platform.

There's no other way to reach so many potential customers, he says, and they all expect two-day delivery. ""I honestly believe that we wouldn't be around if it wasn't for Amazon,"" Rollens says.

Growth is a full-time job: The two-year-old company, which is based in Granite Bay, California, dedicated two people to maintaining Amazon listings and figuring out what keywords work best, since the sales algorithms are opaque and change frequently.

""We spend a lot of time trying to reverse engineer stuff,"" Rollens says. ""It's a daily requirement to go through and look at everything.""

Amazon's execution, however, isn't always flawless. There's little that a seller can do about items sent to the wrong address, rivals who might lodge complaints to bring down their ranking, or buyers who return something after using it.

The complexity of Amazon's platform — and the power that the company holds over a seller's livelihood — has given rise to a robust community of Facebook groups and other online forums where sellers troubleshoot problems and share experiences. There's also a cottage industry of consultants and software vendors who promise to boost sales and get sellers out of trouble, as well as insurance offerings in case one gets booted from the platform unpredictably.

Chris McCabe, who worked in the seller support department at Amazon for six years before starting his own consulting business, says sellers usually end up eating the cost of customer complaints and even foul play by the competition.

""Part of the seller relationship with Amazon is granting them very liberal powers over your money and over your inventory,"" McCabe says. ""[Amazon] Prime is going to help you sell exponentially more than you might on Walmart or Jet or eBay, but you have to do it their way. You can't struggle and fight with them.""

Some sellers who supply inventory wholesale to Amazon are shocked to find that the listings for their products can suddenly go dead because Amazon's algorithm determines it Can't Realize a Profit — a phenomenon known by its acronym, CRAPping out.

In order to get reinstated after a suspension, sellers say they must submit detailed documentation to a support system that mostly operates over email and through online chats.

""There is literally no justice for sellers,"" says Kazmi. ""[Amazon doesn't] owe you anything. But there's no competition, there's no place you can go.""

After getting nowhere for a few months, Kazmi hired another consultant, who advised her to email an Amazon vice president. The executive's assistant got back to her the same day, and her account was swiftly restored.

Amazon says it is accessible by phone 24 hours a day for seller questions, and offers many self-service help pages online. ""We interact with sellers thousands of times a day through a variety of channels and will continue to make sure we maintain that open dialogue,"" a spokesperson from Amazon told CNN Business.

But since access to that universe is indispensable, for the most part, sellers understand that their host cracks down first and asks questions later to prevent any kind of seller abuse that could turn off buyers.

In Calgary, Canada, IT project manager Vladimir Vylegzhanin had built a tidy business selling ping pong paddles on Amazon. But then he switched bank accounts, which he thinks triggered a suspension because it may have appeared he was operating multiple accounts on the platform, a big no-no. Even after getting reinstated — which took months — he was later suspended again for the same reason, and finally he gave up.

Amazon declined to comment on the record about individual sellers.

""The only thing that Amazon is fighting for is their customers, because this is something that's hard to get, but not sellers,"" Vylegzhanin says. He doesn't hold that against the company, but warns prospective sellers to diversify their sales channels in order to stay afloat if Amazon cuts them off.

""Like an 800-pound gorilla with a hand grenade, you can't always understand what they will do next,"" he says. ""It's good while it lasts, but it can always end. Amazon should be just a part of your business."""

Instead it may be left with a version of one of Facebook's biggest failures.

In 2011, as Facebook was rapidly approaching the one-billion-active-user milestone, Google made a last-ditch effort to beat back its online rival with the launch of a rival social network called Google+. The service unmistakably resembled Facebook, though with some novel additions, including more customized sharing options and group video chats.

Seven years later, Google+ — the also-ran social network that Google was never willing to let die — is finally being moved to the company's trash folder, joining previously abandoned social products like Google Reader, Wave, Buzz and Orkut.

But it appears Google Plus may have lasted just long enough to land Google in hot water.

Google said Monday that it is shutting down Google Plus for consumer use after discovering a security bug that exposed the personal information of as many as 500,000 accounts on the social network. Worse still: Google waited more than six months to publicly disclose the security issue.

The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the bug, said Google's legal and policy team warned senior executives at the company that disclosing the security flaw could lead to ""immediate regulatory interest."" Google discovered the security bug in March, the same month that Facebook's Cambridge Analytica data scandal came to light, prompting a global privacy backlash

Google, for its part, says it found ""no evidence"" that any data was actually misused. To decide whether to notify the public, Google says its Privacy & Data Protection Office reviewed ""the type of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. None of these thresholds were met in this instance.""

The security issue, and the company's delayed disclosure of it, risks exposing Google to the same regulatory scrutiny that has plagued Facebook — and all because of a product that was intended to help Google better compete with Facebook.

The Irish Data Protection Commission said WHEN? it wants to get more information from Google. Officials in Germany are also looking into the situation . Vera Jourova, Europe's top justice official, called the Google news ""another reminder"" of why the European Union ""was right to go ahead with modern data protection rules,"" namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The FTC alleged at the time that some of Google's Gmail users were enrolled in certain Buzz features even if they had opted not to be. The commission also charged that users ""were not adequately informed that the identity of individuals they emailed most frequently would be made public by default.""

Ashkan Soltani, a former FTC technologist who worked at the agency when it pursued investigations into Google and Facebook in 2011, told CNN Business the Google+ security issue could once again cause the FTC to investigate Google. But he said it will ""depend on political pressure,"" because there are ""much larger breaches to contend with.""

""Google's breach is far smaller than Facebook's in terms of the number of accounts affected,"" said Mike Chapple, who teaches business analytics and cybersecurity courses at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.

Call it an odd twist of fate that the saving grace for Google right now may be that one of its products failed to take off with users. Google even appeared to play up this point in its blog post announcing the shutdown this week. Google Plus ""has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption,"" the company said. ""90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds."""

        EBay has accused Amazon of using an ""unlawful"" scheme to tempt sellers on its auction site to move to the online retailer.

        EBay has accused Amazon of using an ""unlawful"" scheme to tempt sellers on its auction site to move to the online retailer.
In a cease and desist letter, the auction site alleged that Amazon had used its internal messaging system to repeatedly contact traders.
EBay warned that it would take ""appropriate steps"" to protect itself from the tactic.
Amazon said it had started a ""thorough investigation"" of eBay's claims.
Details of Amazon's alleged activities emerged in a report published in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.

The South Korean electronics giant is forecasting operating profits of around 17.5 trillion won ($15.5bn; £11.9 bn), up 20.4% from a year ago.
The guidance is above analyst estimates for the period, boosted by its thriving chip business. 
Samsung overtook Intel to become the biggest chipmaker last year.
The firm expects consolidated sales will reach around 65 trillion won in the three months to September, up 4.8% on last year. Shares were steady following the guidance update. 
The South Korean firm has seen earnings surge in recent years largely due to demand for memory chips in mobile devices, but falling prices for some electronic components could hit further earnings growth. 
Chips account for nearly 80% of its operating profit, according to Reuters. 
It has also confronted some challenges in its mobile unit and in July, Samsung posted lower-than-expected sales of its flagship Galaxy 9 smartphones.
The firm is facing fierce competition from Apple and Chinese rivals, including device maker Huawei, which recently became the second biggest smartphone seller in the world. 
A worldwide recall of its Galaxy Note 7 devices over exploding batteries in 2016 cost the company billions of dollars. 
Samsung is due to publish a detailed third quarter earnings later this month."

         The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Stan Boland, founder and chief executive of UK driverless car company Five AI.
As firms around the world race to develop self-driving cars, Stan Boland is betting that British brain power can beat American and Chinese cash.
A veteran technology entrepreneur, the 58-year-old launched Five AI in 2016.
Since then it has been moving as quickly as possible to design a driverless car that - the hope is - will at some point in the future gain regulatory approval to take to the roads without someone being behind the wheel as a human failsafe.

                    The company is now testing its cars on the busy roads of south London
                
            
            
        The problem is that, compared with US giants Google, Uber and Tesla, Five AI is a tiny start-up company with only a fraction of the funding that its rivals' driverless car projects are receiving.
Google, for example, spent at least $1.1bn on developing self-driving vehicles between 2009 and 2015. By contrast, Five AI has so far received investment of only £29m ($38m).
And when it comes to number of employees, Google's autonomous vehicle business Waymo is estimated to have some 3,500, and Uber's self-driving arm is said to have about 2,000. While both of these declined to share exact staff numbers, Five AI's workforce currently totals just 120 people.
To the casual observer, Mr Boland and his team cannot hope to compete with his American rivals, nor the hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by Chinese group Baidu, and carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and BMW.
Mr Boland freely admits that his project is ""a gamble"", and that ""a number of bets have got to come off for it to work"", but there is no doubting his ambition.
""We are building a company that I actually think will be worth tens of billions, if not more, but it is going to take a lot of focused effort to get there,"" he says.

        At this point many people may scoff, but with Five AI technicians now testing its adapted Ford Mondeos on the streets of south London, Mr Boland's back story suggests he should be taken seriously.
A physics graduate from Cambridge University, he is a multi-millionaire who has grown and sold two British technology companies for a combined value of more than $1bn.
The first was Element 14, a digital data transfer business.
He was chief executive of the company in January 1999 when it was spun out from former owner Acorn Computers.
Just 18 months later Mr Boland organised the sale of Element 14 to US group Broadcom for $640m.
Then in 2002 he set up semi-conductor firm Icera, which he sold in 2011 to US company Nvidia for $367m.
Mr Boland, who went to a grammar school in Manchester, has also been a director of UK semi-conductor group ARM Holdings.

        While he admits that Five AI is going to need more investment to fully develop its vehicles, he says it can do it more cheaply than its rivals, because it doesn't need to employ the vast number of supplementary staff that they do.
""There is always a team of 20 to 50 people [at any driverless car company] that is really driving the technology,"" he says. ""That is what it comes down to.
""So while Google's Waymo has [an estimated] 3,500 people, and Uber a couple of thousand, it really all comes down to just a handful of individuals.
""And the talent in computer vision and machine learning here in Europe is as strong as in the US.""
Based across six offices in the UK - London, Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford and at a testing track in Bedfordshire - Five AI also works closely with computer vision and artificial intelligence teams at the UK's top universities, and the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's leading AI research centre.
Mr Boland says that he wants all of his staff to ""feel ownership of the company"", so all are given shares in the business.
This is a policy he has insisted on throughout his career, as he believes it makes employees more committed, more hardworking.
Back when he sold Element 14 it meant that most staff became millionaires overnight. ""The least anyone made from the sale was a part-time secretary, and she received £250,000.""

        The business model for Five AI is not that its cars will be available for consumers to buy. Instead it plans to offer a shared taxi service.
Its test cars are fitted with 14 cameras, six radars, three light radars, and computers that make 300 trillion calculators per second.
The aim is to start offering a commercial service in London by 2022, albeit with a company employee in the driving seat just in case.

        The hope is to go fully driverless at some point after that if the technology and regulators allow. And beat the likes of Waymo and Uber to market domination, at least in Europe.
""It is a massive ask from where we are today, but I do think that in the next three or four years we are going to get to a level where the cars are equal to human levels of safety,"" says Mr Boland. ""And then we want to improve from there.""

                    There is a very competitive global race to create driverless cars
                
            
            
        But will enough members of the public ever be willing to step into a driverless taxi?
UK motoring journalist Robin Roberts isn't sure.
""I think that most people would not feel that confident,"" he says.
""Humans are able to react very quickly to their surroundings, and unforeseen events that happen on the roads. I don't think that a programmed computer could ever do the same as safely.
""There is no substitute for human reason in situations where split-second decisions have to be made.""
However, Mr Boland is confident. ""We are going to transform the way our cities operate. It is going to be a massive revolution."""

        Amazon has reported more than 440 health and safety incidents at its UK warehouses since 2015, according to Freedom of Information (FoI) requests.
The GMB union requested information from local authorities throughout the UK.
It discovered that workers had suffered fractures, head injuries, contusions, and collisions with heavy equipment.
Amazon said it had 43% fewer injuries on average than other transportation and warehousing companies in the UK.
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) figures show that in 2016-2017, in the warehousing and transportation support industries, there were 1,577 reported non-fatal injuries per 100,000 workers.
""Amazon is a safe place to work and reports to the contrary are simply wrong,"" an Amazon spokesman told the BBC. 
""Amazon has created more than 25,000 good jobs with good pay and benefits across Britain and we are proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.""
Rise in accidents
According to the data collected from the FoI requests, in 2015-2016 there were 80 health and safety incidents. 
This number rose to 114 in 2016-2017, and then to 149 in 2017-2018. 
So far in 2018-2019, there have been 99 health and safety incidents. 
The GMB said the actual numbers were probably higher, because some local authorities were unable to provide details of incident reports.

        Sony's president has confirmed that his company is developing a new video games console.
Kenichiro Yoshida told the Financial Times that ""it's necessary to have a next-generation hardware"".
However, he declined to say whether the successor would be branded the PlayStation 5, the newspaper added.

        It has said public trials were scheduled to start next year.
Meanwhile, Google unveiled Project Stream last week. 
The ""technical test"" allows select gamers to play the latest Assassin's Creed game via the search firm's Chrome web browser.
All the internet-based solutions face latency issues - meaning there is a longer lag between pressing a gamepad button and getting a response than there would be if the relevant computing tasks were carried out in the same room as the player.
This delay tends to increase the further away the player is based from the data centre doing the grunt work.
That is a particular problem for fighting and shooting titles, where success or defeat can be determined by how many milliseconds it takes a player to react.
Flawless experience
One industry watcher said this and other issues meant there was likely to be at least one more generation of hardware that ran games locally.
""There are concerns from a technical standpoint that not everyone would be able to get a flawless experience,"" said Daniel Dawkins, global editor-in-chief of the news site Gamesradar+.
""Ownership of the [physical machines] also helps inspire loyalty and a sense of community. A lot of people would hate the idea of giving up the boxes.""
Another expert added that launching new hardware was a proven way to attract lapsed gamers back to the activity.
""A lot of us love a gadget,"" said games journalist Ellie Gibson.
""Sometimes you just want a shiny new toy."""

        Google has launched its latest smartphones  under the shadow of a data exposure scandal.
The Pixel 3 handsets introduce new photography features including a much higher-quality digital zoom than before.
The company suggests the innovation shows it has no need to place more than one camera on the handsets' rear.
The launch comes a day after it emerged that a Google+ bug was not made public when it was discovered in the Spring.
The flaw led to personal data belonging to 500,000 members of the social network not being properly protected.
Google has announced it is now ending access to the service to the wider public.

        The Pixel phones will not be directly affected by the move, but do make use of several of the firm's cloud-based technologies including Google Photos - an image storage service that was spun out from Google+ three years ago.
One industry-watcher said part of the company's motivation for offering the Pixel 3 and larger Pixel 3 XL was to promote ""the best of Google"", adding that the message would now be harder to convey. 
""The value proposition of Pixel is not just the hardware but the whole Google experience,"" explained Carolina Milanesi from the consultancy Creative Strategies.
""If you're starting to question Google and whether or not you want to be entrenched in its services, then the value that you'll see in the handsets will decline.""
Despite positive reviews for previous editions of the Pixel, they have been niche products.

        Google attained a peak smartphone market share of just 0.53% in the final three months of 2017, according to market research firm IDC, and has since seen that drop to 0.14%.
Photo advances
Many of the benefits of the new phones are derived from them coming with the latest version of Android and integrating Google's services more seamlessly. For example, the firm's virtual assistant can now be triggered by squeezing the devices' sides.
But the Pixel team also hopes several photography-related features will have special appeal.
Unusually, the handsets now have more cameras on their fronts than rears.
A second wide-angle lens has been added to the phones' face to make it easier to take group shots without the need for a selfie stick. Software is automatically applied to the resulting images to correct for distortions.

                    Google says the Pixel 3 camera can capture 184% more of the scene in a selfie than Apple's iPhone XS
                
            
            
        In addition, algorithms originally developed for the firm's standalone Clips camera have been integrated to automatically take photos at the best moment - for example just as subjects smile or open their eyes - to avoid the need for a button tap.
However, the firm has kept to a single rear camera on both models despite a trend among other firms to build more into their premium models. 
The Galaxy S9 and iPhone XS, for example, have two back cameras. Huawei's P20 Pro and LG's V40 have three. And leaks suggest Nokia is working on a phone with five.
One advantage of having more lenses is that each can offer a different focal length, letting users optically zoom in without a substantial loss in quality.
But Google's Super Res mode aims to emulate this using digital zoom alone.
It does this by first sampling pixels taken from slightly different points-of-view, captured as a result of small vibrations in the owner's hand. 
It then uses software to combine the information into a higher-resolution image from which the cropped-in view is extracted.
If the phone is locked to a tripod or otherwise steadied, the camera sensor's image stabiliser slightly moves it about to get the same effect.
A second computational photography mode called Night Sight is also promised as a future update to take photos in low-light conditions without a flash.

                    Night Sight uses artificial intelligence to add colour to low light photos
                
            
            
        It works by taking several frames at different exposures and then merging the data together while using machine learning-trained software to add back colour.
This approach contrasts with that of Samsung, which introduced a dual-aperture lens to allow more light in when required.
The executive responsible, Mario Queiroz, said Google had deliberately sought out software-based solutions.
""You can brute-force your way to functionality by putting in a bunch of hardware,"" he explained.
""But I think you may be wasting hardware in that case and potentially making your phone more costly.""
One expert suggested this approach could backfire.
""Despite the fact Google has already proved that having a single lens offering exceptional performance can pay off, to the uneducated consumer there's a natural assumption that two lenses are better and three lenses spectacularly so,"" commented Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.

        The firm also showed off a new Chrome OS tablet - the Slate - which comes with a detachable keyboard similar to that of Microsoft's Surface.
In addition, its smart speaker range gained a screen-based model called the Home Hub, which will compete with Amazon's Echo Show. 
Google said it had deliberately built the device without a camera in order to reduce privacy concerns around positioning it in personal places like the bedroom.

        Google is fighting a record €4.3bn ($4.9bn; £3.8bn) fine for allegedly using the Android operating system to ""cement its dominance"" as a search engine.
In July, the European Commission said Google's Android policies had ""denied rivals the chance to innovate and compete"".
The company could face further fines if it does not change its practices.
Google's appeal could take several years.
""We have now filed our appeal,"" the company said in a statement reported by the Financial Times.
What was Google accused of?
Google was accused of acting illegally because:

it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store

it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators so that they agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices

it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps


Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines.
But the EU's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser.

""Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,"" she said in July.
How has Google responded?
Following the fine, Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said Android had enabled ""rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices"".
He said the decision ""rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less"".
The company was given until the end of October to make changes to Android that would satisfy the EU's demands.It told the Financial Times that it had no plans to ask the EU to change that deadline.
In 2017, Google faced similar complaints from the Russian regulator.
It now offers Android users in Russia a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser.
Yandex in particular appears to have benefited from this change.
Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based company has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%, according to Statcounter."
