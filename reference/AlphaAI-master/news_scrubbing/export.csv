AutoNavi, Alibaba Holding’s maps app, said this week it crossed the 100 million daily users threshold on the first day of China’s Golden Week holiday, becoming the first maps service to reach such a milestone in China. The company hit the 100 million user mark at close to 8pm on October 1, China’s National Day, the first day of a week-long holiday in mainland China when millions of people are travelling to meet family and friends. The 100 million daily active users (DAU) milestone means that AutoNavi has likely surpassed Baidu Maps, its biggest rival in China’s mapping and navigation industry. Data from Quest Mobile last year showed that Baidu Maps had 300 million monthly active users, although the company has not publicly announced its latest daily active user numbers.

Dialog shares surged as much as 34 percent on Thursday, their most since 2002, as the deal bought the company time to reduce its dependence on Apple - which it expects to account for three-quarters of this year's sales. Dialog's shares had tumbled earlier this year when it said Apple planned to use chips from another supplier. Under the deal, Apple is buying patents, taking on a 300-strong engineering team, most of whom already worked on chips for Apple devices, and Dialog offices in Britain, Italy and Germany.

The high to mid-price market demands delivery and is already served by Deliveroo and Uber Eats, while for lower-price customers, chains are strongly expanding into rural areas, cannibalizing Just Eat’s marketplace, said Diebel, who has an underweight rating on the shares.",https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/just-eat-stock-fails-deliver-040000750.html

Asian markets plunged Thursday morning following the worst session on Wall Street for months, as US President Donald Trump said the Federal Reserve had ""gone crazy"" with plans for higher interest rates. The steep drop in Asia followed a decline on Wall Street of nearly 830 points, the biggest fall since February, amid Trump's latest criticism of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. Stocks have been under pressure since the yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds jumped above three percent last week, a sudden move that raised fears of an overheating economy, speeding inflation and more aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate increases. Last week's jump in yields followed strong US data but many analysts have been anticipating a change in the dynamics in the bond market due to expectations that central banks in Europe and Japan will soon phase out bond-buying programmes.

That way, if people in the disaster area have only intermittent service and can't get in touch with each other directly, or even have to borrow someone else's phone, there will still be a central source of information for your family.

It may not suit religious or culturally conservative people, who may have a harder time dealing with the kind of stuff out there

For users, this could be the end of granting forced SMS permissions that many Indian apps seek, and premature app uploads, like in the case of local messaging app Khimbo that was pulled down due to glaring faults in its security system.Experts say Google’s move is particularly significant in a market like India where users are unaware of data implications and end up freely granting app permissions. “Google’s decision to prohibit apps from accessing SMS logs and call data records of its users will have a huge significant effect on fintech firms in India, something none of them were prepared for,” said Kunal Shah, founder of payments startup Freecharge.In addition to limiting an app’s ability to seek access to call logs and texts, Google will now provide granular details of what permissions a user gives for using a specific app. Apps that allow users to log in via Google’s sign-on feature will have to show each requested permission one at a time in separate dialogue boxes, instead of in a single screen.Developer policies at large technology firms like Facebook and Google are being reshaped following a string of privacy snafus recently. “Google and other developer ecosystems are slowly moving towards Apple’s user consent policy—a more protected system,” said Prajyot Mainkar, founder of Androcid Media, an Android application development firm.While the new policies put user privacy at their centre, the development has increased the barriers for application developers.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/google-limits-third-party-app-access-to-users-data/articleshow/66142230.cms

190,Government ups import duty on telecom gear to trim trade deficit - Times of India,Times of India,2018-10-12,0.821227,0.997804,"NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday raised customs duty on eight components and equipment used by the telecom sector as it sought to reduce the dependence on imported goods in a sector with burgeoning demand, which could outstrip the value of oil imports in the coming years.This is the second round of duty increase in as many weeks to cut down on what is viewed as ""non-essential"" imports and save precious dollars at a time when the trade and the current account deficit are widening and piling pressure on the rupee, which has plunged over 15% against the US dollar, making it the worst performing Asian currency so far in 2018. The increase in import tariff will impact prices of key equipment such as base stations, optical transport equipment and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gear. The government has already raised the import duty on mobile phones, which have been spared in this round, tax consultants said. ""The increased import duty rates on some of these products would entail an additional burden on the telecom industry, where these goods are imported,"" said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY.India's telecom equipment imports were estimated at close to $22 billion during the last financial year, according to data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). During this period, oil imports were pegged at $88 billion, and are expected to rise significantly this year due to a spike in global prices, which continue to hover above the $80-per-barrel mark.The only positive is the increased assembly of mobile phones in the country, with several global players such as Samsung and Xiaomi setting up units here, while other such as Apple are yet to firm up plans, despite being in talks for several years.In the last round, the government had increased import duty on air conditioners, washing machines, refrigerators, textiles and diamonds in an attempt to trim current account deficit, which is the difference between exports and imports and other inflows such as investments and remittances.The measures were, however, seen to be meagre as the value of these imports were estimated at a little over $12 billion, with trade experts fearing that the source of shipments would move to countries such as Vietnam and Korea with which India has free trade agreements.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/govt-ups-import-duty-on-tele-gear-to-trim-trade-deficit/articleshow/66172332.cms

Three of the five momentum stocks collectively known as FAANGs - Facebook Inc , Netflix Inc and Google parent company Alphabet Inc - make up roughly half of the new sector by market capitalization. The other FAANG stocks, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc , remain in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors, respectively. Also, several of the sector's growth companies - Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter - face regulatory risks that tech companies do not. Given the risks to the communication sector's internet stocks, the sector is less attractive than technology or consumer discretionary for investors seeking growth, said Wren.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6270297/Wall-St-Week-Ahead-New-communication-sectors-shine-soon-wear-off.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490

Seeking to ensure a level playing field between tech giants such as Google, Amazon and Apple and traditional businesses, the European Commission in April outlined draft rules to prevent unfair business practices. European Parliament lawmakers, whose approval is needed to ensure the proposal becomes legislation and under pressure to be seen as consumer-friendly ahead of elections in May, have since come up with about 680 amendments to beef up the draft. Key among these is the one proposed last week by Danish centre-left lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, the lead parliament negotiator, which takes aim at a case her compatriot, European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, is looking into. In her amendment, Schaldemose referred to investigations by antitrust regulators in the European Union and elsewhere into online intermediation services' dual role as a marketplace and as a rival on the same platform.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-6270575/Key-EU-lawmakers-plan-rein-online-marketplaces-threat-Amazon.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490

Turkey's investigation into the disappearance of Khashoggi on Oct. 2 after he entered the consulate has revealed recordings made on his Apple Watch purportedly indicating he was tortured and killed, a Turkish newspaper reported on Saturday. Khashoggi has been a prominent critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident who has written columns for the Washington Post.

259,Apple's New Proprietary Software Locks Kill Independent Repair on New MacBook Pros,Vice,2018-10-04,0.83075,0.961204,"Apple has introduced software locks that will effectively prevent independent and third-party repair on 2018 MacBook Pro computers, according to internal Apple documents obtained by Motherboard. The new system will render the computer “inoperative” unless a proprietary Apple “system configuration” software is run after parts of the system are replaced. The computer will only begin functioning again after Apple or a member of one of Apple’s Authorized Service Provider repair program runs diagnostic software called Apple Service Toolkit 2. “For Macs with the Apple T2 chip, the repair process is not complete for certain parts replacements until the AST 2 System Configuration suite has been run.

Some of its hardware lagged behind in pure hardware specs, but Pixel 2 was a phone that stood out for how its camera reliably produced photos that blew expectations. Instead of flashy new hardware upgrades (the Pixel 3’s camera has the same number of megapixels as the Pixel 2’s), it built algorithms to create new types of photos. By betting that software alone can produce better results than the diminishing returns on the hardware front every year, Google has discovered a secret weapon: it’s building devices that get better as they learn, and don’t require an upgrade to get the fancy new technology. Google’s bet long term is that software will always produce a better result, and with the Pixel event today it showed off the power of that approach by pushing ever more sophisticated features out across its entire lineup, rather than new devices, and improving them over time.",https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/7x3m8b/pixel-3-camera-software-pixel-xl
